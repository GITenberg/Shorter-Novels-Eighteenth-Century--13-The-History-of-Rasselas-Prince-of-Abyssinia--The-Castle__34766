<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="center sm">[<a href="#CONTENTS">Skip to Contents</a>]</p>

<p>The three novels collected here all belong to the later years
of the eighteenth century. The first represents what may be
called the last stand of Augustanism before that riot of fancy
and imagination, as exemplified by the other two tales,
that ushered in the Romantic Revival. Thus in <i>Rasselas</i> we
have Johnson, with the fortitude of Atlas, supporting the
miseries of the world on his broad shoulders; Horace Walpole
shutting us up in his <i>Castle of Otranto</i>, away from reality and
all reasonableness; and Beckford, in <i>Vathek</i>, transporting us
on his magic carpet to the court of the grandson of Haroun
al Raschid, and thence to a region of perdition and eternal
fire, where all memory of Augustanism is irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>They are strange company these three books, but they are
nevertheless infallible indexes to the taste of their time. The
fact that <i>Rasselas</i> in 1759 met with such enormous success
and that <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> four years later met with
perhaps an equal success, indicates as plainly as anything
could that although people had not lost their admiration for
Johnson, they were already tiring of “good sense” and quite
willing to give free play to those wilder impulses in their
natures that Augustanism had sought to discipline. But
this time the tide turned with a vengeance! The grave
Wordsworth, a romantic himself, is found deploring the
“frantic novels” of this time, although Shelley’s young and
fiery imagination seized upon them with avidity, and, in
<i>Zastrozzi</i>, he wrote an even more frantic one himself. But
it was <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>, written in conscious reaction
against the domesticities and sentiment of Richardson, with
its plea that the material of the novel could be taken from
anything <em>but</em> the events of ordinary life, that opened the
gates onto the land of Romance. And in its train came all
the rest of the “Gothic” and “terror” novelists&mdash;Clara Reeve,
Mrs. Radcliffe, “Monk” Lewis, Charles Maturin&mdash;to mention
only those who are now chiefly remembered. <i>Vathek</i>, however,
stands alone, without predecessors or immediate followers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
belonging to a quite un-English tradition, although the
Oriental tale in one shape or another had quite a vogue in
the eighteenth century&mdash;if we may include such things as
Collins’s <i>Persian Eclogues</i> and Goldsmith’s Chinaman, or even
<i>Rasselas</i> itself, which, at least, has a nominal setting in
the East.</p>

<p><i>Rasselas</i> was written, as every one knows, during the evenings
of a week, when Johnson “had occasion for thirty pounds on
Monday night,” as he wrote to the printer on 20 January,
1759. His mother had just died and he sat down in his
Gough Square garret to earn the necessary money for her
funeral and for paying off the few debts she had left. Her
death, we are told, was a great loss to Johnson, and it is
wonderful that what he wrote under pressure at that time
should be free not only from bitterness but from a complaint
of any kind. Melancholy it certainly is, but melancholy with
a rare elevation of mind and no more weighed down with
thought&mdash;a rather foolish charge that is sometimes levelled
against it&mdash;than is any work that deals profoundly with the
major problems of life. It has also been said of <i>Rasselas</i>,
with more reason, that it is a test of the reader’s capacity to
appreciate the peculiar qualities of Johnson’s thought. These
qualities, as any one who takes the trouble to analyse them
can see for himself, are a square face to face attitude to life
that takes things as they come, realizing the futility of attempting
“a choice of life,” and if without overmuch hope for the
future, at least free from the disintegration of high hopes
disappointed. There is nothing pedantic or high-flown in
this attitude which, with a noble solemnity, enabled Johnson
to bear up against all odds and to steer right on. Undeniably
there is sustenance to be got from <i>Rasselas</i>. And if its
author has certain qualities in common with his own “solemn
elephant reposing in the shade,” they are, one feels, the
product of a character that, like Donne’s elephant, could
hardly be dislodged without the noise and cataclysm of a
whole town undermined&mdash;whereas much of the style of to-day,
which despises what it calls “Johnsonese,” could be blown
away with a puff of wind. What obtuseness there is in
Johnson’s attitude of mind is due to the qualities that he
shared with “the giant of beasts,” a slow-movingness and an
apparent lack of the more intricate nerves of feeling. Compare
his prose with its antithesis, that of Donne, who, for all
his medieval theology, was more modern in the working of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
his mind than Johnson; for whereas the author of <i>Rasselas</i>
will bring you surely and by slow degrees to a conclusion,
the mind of the author of <i>Death’s Duel</i> and the sermons seems
to anticipate all conclusions at once with the rapidity and
circuitousness of a thousand ants. Johnson will attack a
problem broadside on, and it is to him we come for substantial
resistance against life, but to Donne we go for an inward and
self-conscious activity that undermines it. Yet one would
read <i>Rasselas</i> ten times for every single reading of Donne’s
sermons, which are as the fire of the spirit consuming.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, then, <i>Rasselas</i> is a prose <i>Vanity of Human
Wishes</i>, a disquisition on the limitations of life rather than
a novel holding our attention by a sequence of events. How
characteristic is the passage on the pyramids! Only Johnson,
who kept his head among the Highland mountains, could
have written as he does here, summing up, in these two
sentences, his whole attitude towards happiness and material
possessions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I consider this mighty structure as a monument of the insufficiency
of human enjoyments. A king whose power is unlimited, and whose
treasures surmount all real and imaginary wants, is compelled to
solace, by the erection of a Pyramid, the satiety of dominion and
tastelessness of pleasures, and to amuse the tediousness of declining
life by seeing thousands labouring without end, and one stone, for
no purpose, laid upon another.</p></div>

<p>Surely that is magnificent prose, and no one else could
have written with just that fine balance and that same
elevation of mind&mdash;unless it was Browne, also pitying the
builder of the pyramids in <i>Hydriotaphia</i>.</p>

<p>To pass on to <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> from <i>Rasselas</i> is like
going from the reality and reasonable order of Kew Gardens,
with its noble lawns and splendidly cultivated trees, into
some side-show of artificial medievalism, complete with ghosts
in rattling armour, skeletons and knights, at the White
City or the old Earl’s Court Exhibition. At a step we leave
behind us the familiar light of day for a castle of uneasy
spirits with the wind whining through its battlements. Otranto
is such a castle, indeed, as never existed and its people were
never anywhere but inside its walls. It is a Gothic “shocker”
which is neither truly Gothic nor shocking; for its terror-apparatus
has ceased to make us tremble and its chivalrous
cant and heroical sentiments no longer quicken our heart.
And yet there is something about this absurd tale that still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
holds our attention&mdash;a spark of genius perhaps that occasionally
flashes out through the cracks in the rusty armour
and the turret windows; and it is this that hurries it impetuously
to its climax of furious bathos not altogether without
the sweep of tragedy. Yet did one not know beforehand that
the book was written in good faith, there would be every
excuse for mistaking it for an uproarious parody of the old
type of medieval romance.</p>

<p>To Sir Walter Scott, however, Horace Walpole’s castle was
anything but an occasion for mirth. Evidently writing
against the general opinion of the book at that time, he
says, in his chapter on Walpole in <i>The Lives of the Novelists</i>,
that it is doing the author an injustice to suppose that his
sole purpose was to terrorize his readers. Walpole’s intention
was, he assures us, to depict the social life of the Middle
Ages about the time of the first Crusade, although he admits
that “by the too frequent recurrence of his prodigies, Mr.
Walpole ran, perhaps, his greatest risk of awakening <i>la raison
froide</i>, that cold common sense, which he justly deemed the
greatest enemy of the effect which he hoped to produce.”
But it does not require very much cold common sense to
discern that, for all this supernatural paraphernalia, <i>The
Castle of Otranto</i>, unlike Mrs. Radcliffe’s books, lacks atmosphere&mdash;the
first essential in preparing the mind for legendary
happenings. It is simply foolish to bring what purport to
be supernatural phenomena into broad daylight and then to
expect us to believe in their reality. But when Scott writes
of “the gigantic and preposterous figures dimly visible in the
defaced tapestry&mdash;the remote clang of the distant doors
which divide him from living society&mdash;the deep darkness
which involves the high and fretted roof of the apartment&mdash;the
dimly-seen pictures of ancient knights, renowned for their
valour, and perhaps for their crimes&mdash;the varied and indistinct
sounds which disturb the silent desolation of a half-deserted
mansion,” he at once awakes the imagination and
creates an atmosphere pregnant with the foreboding of
invisible presences that prepares the reader to believe almost
anything. Scott can raise our hair in a sentence, but all
Walpole’s bleeding statues and sighing pictures can only
move us to a certain mild amusement. It is obvious, too,
that in his generous tribute to Walpole, Scott was carried away
by a conception of his own of what his predecessor <i>might</i> have
done. Moreover, he was anxious to own his debt to Walpole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
for introducing an element into the novel that he himself
was to develop in a way that is still unsurpassed. For nowadays,
although Walpole, and his immediate follower Clara
Reeve, with her <i>Old English Baron</i> (1777), actually introduced
it, it is not of Walpole or Reeve that we think when the
historical novel is mentioned, but of Scott. But being the
first attempt of its kind on any serious scale, it is natural
that Scott should have respected <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>, although
we of to-day, having the whole varied wealth of Scott’s
imagination behind us, as well as the work of his many
followers, find it harder to give Walpole the just measure of
praise that, in spite of attendant absurdities, is his due.</p>

<p>The mysterious inconsistencies of <i>Vathek</i> (1786) have been
sufficiently remarked. But every fresh reader cannot help
being struck by the strange contrast between the cynical
flippancies of the earlier portions and the sombre grandeur
and moral conviction inspiring the scenes in the Hall of Eblis.
Should we take <i>Vathek</i> merely as an extravaganza with a
moral turn&mdash;which only serves to make it the more macabre&mdash;in
which the characters, not being responsible for their
actions, are scarcely culpable; or should we take it as an
allegory of the vanity of unrestrained desires and inordinate
ambition promoting “that blind curiosity which would transgress
the bounds of wisdom the Creator has prescribed to
human knowledge”? Perhaps Beckford did not intend his
tale to be interpreted too solemnly. Some indication of his
attitude is given in a letter to Henley dated 23 April, 1785,
in which, speaking of the most innocent of his characters,
he says: “I have always thought Nouronihar too severely
punished, and if I knew how conveniently, would add a crime
or two to her share. What say you?” But it would be a
mistake to imagine that Beckford was in any way ashamed
of his production&mdash;far from it!&mdash;and it may be that, like
Voltaire, he was in the habit of saying the most serious things
flippantly. As it is, Vathek himself with his basilisk glance
and outrageous appetite is partly a figure of fun, and, by his
black magic and pact with the powers of darkness, partly
an Oriental Faust, helped on to damnation by his mother,
the Princess Carathis, who with her insane thirst for supernatural
dominion is a more ghastly Lady Macbeth. But
however we regard the enigma of <i>Vathek</i>, Beckford’s real
claim to remembrance rests on the half-dozen pages at the
end of the book, where his description of the Hall of Eblis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
has been compared to Milton’s Pandemonium, Eblis himself
being considered as a kind of inferior Satan. And perhaps
there is a touch of <i>Salammbô</i> as well, as Vathek and Nouronihar
stand before the ruins of Istakar, with their intolerable
mystery and deathly stillness under the moon.</p>

<p>Thus, if <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> has suffered rather badly in
its passage through time, although it will always remain one
of the chief curiosities of our literature, and if we cannot
altogether make up our minds about <i>Vathek</i>, there can be
no doubt whatever of the permanent value of <i>Rasselas</i>. It
is a greater and more subtle book than it is commonly thought
to be. Too many people know only Boswell’s Johnson&mdash;here
we have Johnson himself, discussing marriage, the art
of flying, and the soul. And what strikes us most in re-reading
him now, quite apart from the style which is essentially
of its period, is the modernity of his thought. Even more
than most profound thinkers who are modern for all time
by having reached a certain depth of consciousness that never
changes, Johnson in certain passages of his book astonishes
by the way in which he has anticipated the conclusions of
contemporary thinkers. His conception of the mind is
essentially modern, showing it as at once the creator and
destroyer of all values and systems, and yet “the continuance
of reason” being uncertain&mdash;although madness is determined
only by the degree to which one idea or one set of ideas predominates
to the exclusion of others&mdash;he says, in effect, with
Pirandello&mdash;“That’s the truth if you think it is!” But
realizing the final inefficacy of any one system of belief, and
being deficient in real faith, he was content, like his own
Imlac, “to be driven along the stream of life, without directing
his course to any particular port.” And so <i>Rasselas</i> ends,
as all good discussions on life must, with a conclusion “in
which nothing is concluded.”</p>

<h3>SAMUEL JOHNSON</h3>

<p>The house in which Samuel Johnson was born on 18 September, 1709,
still stands at the corner of the market-place in Lichfield. His father
was a small bookseller in that town, so that from the first Johnson grew
up in the company of books. So widely had he read by the time he went
to Oxford at the age of eighteen that his tutor told him “he was the
best qualified for the University that he had ever known come there.”
Although “miserably poor” and subject to fits of melancholy that were
at times divided only by a thin partition from madness, and cursed by a
kind of St. Vitus’s dance and by scrofula which had disfigured his face
and deprived him of the use of one eye, Johnson determined to “fight
his way by his literature and his wit.” After leaving Oxford, he made
various unsuccessful attempts to get regular employment. At the age of
twenty-six he married a widow twenty years his senior, who, according
to Garrick, was “a fat woman with red painted cheeks, fantastic dress,
and affected manners.” But the marriage was a love match on both
sides, and in spite of ridicule Johnson’s affection remained constant and
unshakable. His wife brought him a meagre fortune, and with this he
opened a school for “young gentlemen” near Lichfield. But the number
of his pupils never exceeded seven, of whom the Garrick brothers were
two. So early in 1737 he set out for London with three acts of a tragedy,
<i>Irene</i>, which he offered to Drury Lane without success. In the following
year he began writing his parliamentary debates for <i>The Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>. In 1744 he wrote his powerful <i>Life of Savage</i>&mdash;forty-eight
octavo pages at a sitting. In 1747 he issued the plan of his dictionary
inscribed to Lord Chesterfield and began work on it at Gough Square.
Two years later Garrick produced <i>Irene</i> at Drury Lane, and although it
brought Johnson quite a nice little sum of money, it was judged on the
whole to be a failure. In 1750, “while he was bearing his burden with
dull patience and beating the track of the alphabet with sluggish resolution,”
he began writing <i>The Rambler</i>, which appeared twice a week and
lasted for two years. Mrs. Johnson died in March 1751 and Johnson
wrote a sermon for her funeral that was never preached. By 1755 the
dictionary was ready for publication, and Chesterfield, who had ignored
the prospectus, delivered himself of a few flippant remarks at Johnson’s
expense in <i>The World</i>. It was on account of this that he brought down
on his head the formidable letter of February the seventh. The dictionary
appeared in two volumes on 15 April. In 1759 Johnson’s mother died,
and he wrote <i>Rasselas</i> to pay the expenses of the funeral. Three years
later, with the accession of George the Third, he received a pension of
£300 a year, and from that time he was free of pecuniary troubles and
able to spend the rest of his life talking in the midst of a brilliant company.
Among his friends were Gibbon, Reynolds, Burke, Goldsmith, Charles
James Fox, Adam Smith, R. B. Sheridan, and Sir William Jones, the
Orientalist. At this time he lived with Miss Williams, the blind orphan
daughter of a man of learning, and a Mr. Levett, “an obscure practiser
in physic.”</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail the events of the remaining twenty-two
years, as they were passed in comparative indolence. His friendship with
Henry Thrale began about 1759, and the Thrales’ fine house at Streatham
Park became, until 1782, Johnson’s chief asylum. The Thrales, he said,
“soothed twenty years of a life radically wretched.” On 16 May, 1768,
he met Boswell. The famous journey to the Highlands was made in
1773, and in 1774 he visited Wales, and the next year Paris. After 1782
his health rapidly declined, and he died after an attack of dropsy on
13 December, 1784, in Bolt Court, Fleet Street.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
<span class="sub">DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY</span></h3>

<p>Ye who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and
pursue with eagerness the phantoms of hope, who expect that
age will perform the promises of youth, and that the deficiencies
of the present day will be supplied by the morrow, attend to
the history of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty emperor, in
whose dominions the Father of Waters begins his course; whose
bounty pours down the streams of plenty, and scatters over
half the world the harvests of Egypt.</p>

<p>According to the custom which has descended from age to
age among the monarchs of the torrid zone, Rasselas was confined
in a private palace, with the other sons and daughters of
Abyssinian royalty, till the order of succession should call him
to the throne.</p>

<p>The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had
destined for the residence of the Abyssinian princes, was a
spacious valley in the kingdom of Amhara, surrounded on
every side by mountains, of which the summits overhang the
middle part. The only passage by which it could be entered,
was a cavern that passed under a rock, of which it has long
been disputed whether it was the work of nature or of human
industry. The outlet of the cavern was concealed by a thick
wood, and the mouth which opened into the valley was closed
with gates of iron, forged by the artificers of ancient days, so
massy that no man could without the help of engines open
or shut them.</p>

<p>From the mountains on every side, rivulets descended, that
filled all the valley with verdure and fertility, and formed a
lake in the middle, inhabited by fish of every species, and
frequented by every fowl whom nature has taught to dip the
wing in water. This lake discharged its superfluities by a
stream, which entered a dark cleft of the mountain on the
northern side, and fell with dreadful noise from precipice to
precipice till it was heard no more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>The sides of the mountains were covered with trees; the
banks of the brooks were diversified with flowers; every blast
shook spices from the rocks, and every month dropped fruits
upon the ground. All animals that bite the grass, or browse
the shrub, whether wild or tame, wandered in this extensive
circuit, secured from beasts of prey by the mountains which
confined them. On one part were flocks and herds feeding
in the pastures, on another all the beasts of chase frisking in
the lawns; the sprightly kid was bounding on the rocks, the
subtle monkey frolicking in the trees, and the solemn elephant
reposing in the shade. All the diversities of the world were
brought together; the blessings of nature were collected, and
its evils extracted and excluded.</p>

<p>The valley, wide and fruitful, supplied its inhabitants with
the necessaries of life, and all delights and superfluities were
added at the annual visit which the emperor paid his children,
when the iron gate was opened to the sound of music, and,
during eight days, every one that resided in the valley was
required to propose whatever might contribute to make seclusion
pleasant, to fill up the vacancies of attention, and lessen the
tediousness of time. Every desire was immediately granted.
All the artificers of pleasure were called to gladden the festivity;
the musicians exerted the power of harmony, and the dancers
showed their activity before the princes, in hope that they
should pass their lives in this blissful captivity, to which those
only were admitted whose performance was thought able to add
novelty to luxury. Such was the appearance of security and
delight which this retirement afforded, that they to whom it
was new always desired that it might be perpetual; and as
those on whom the iron gate had once closed were never suffered
to return, the effect of longer experience could not be known.
Thus every year produced new schemes of delight, and new
competitors for imprisonment.</p>

<p>The palace stood on an eminence, raised about thirty paces
above the surface of the lake. It was divided into many squares
or courts, built with greater or less magnificence, according to
the rank of those for whom they were designed. The roofs
were turned into arches of massy stone, joined by a cement
that grew harder by time; and the building stood from century
to century, deriding the solstitial rains and equinoctial
hurricanes, without need of reparation.</p>

<p>This house, which was so large as to be fully known to none
but some ancient officers who successively inherited the secrets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the place, was built as if suspicion herself had dictated the
plan. To every room there was an open and secret passage;
every square had a communication with the rest, either from the
upper stories by private galleries, or by subterranean passages
from the lower apartments. Many of the columns had unsuspected
cavities, in which a long race of monarchs had reposited
their treasures. They then closed up the opening with marble,
which was never to be removed but in the utmost exigencies of
the kingdom; and recorded their accumulations in a book, which
was itself concealed in a tower, not entered but by the emperor,
attended by the prince who stood next in succession.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE DISCONTENT OF RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY</span></h3>

<p>Here the sons and daughters of Abyssinia lived only to know
the soft vicissitudes of pleasure and repose, attended by all
that were skilful to delight, and gratified with whatever the
senses can enjoy. They wandered in gardens of fragrance, and
slept in the fortresses of security. Every art was practised
to make them pleased with their own condition. The sages
who instructed them told them of nothing but the miseries
of public life, and described all beyond the mountains as
regions of calamity, where discord was always raging, and where
man preyed upon man.</p>

<p>To heighten their opinion of their own felicity, they were
daily entertained with songs, the subject of which was the
Happy Valley. Their appetites were excited by frequent enumerations
of different enjoyments; and revelry and merriment was
the business of every hour, from the dawn of morning to the
close of even.</p>

<p>These methods were generally successful: few of the princes
had ever wished to enlarge their bounds, but passed their
lives in full conviction that they had all within their reach
that art or nature could bestow, and pitied those whom fate
had excluded from this seat of tranquillity, as the sport of
chance and the slaves of misery.</p>

<p>Thus they rose in the morning and lay down at night, pleased
with each other and with themselves, all but Rasselas, who, in
the twenty-sixth year of his age, began to withdraw himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
from their pastimes and assemblies, and to delight in solitary
walks and silent meditation. He often sat before tables covered
with luxury, and forgot to taste the dainties that were placed
before him; he rose abruptly in the midst of the song, and
hastily retired beyond the sound of music. His attendants
observed the change, and endeavoured to renew his love of
pleasure; he neglected their officiousness, repulsed their invitations,
and spent day after day on the banks of rivulets sheltered
with trees, where he sometimes listened to the birds in the
branches, sometimes observed the fish playing in the stream,
and anon cast his eyes upon the pastures and mountains filled
with animals, of which some were biting the herbage, and some
sleeping among the bushes.</p>

<p>This singularity of his humour made him much observed.
One of the sages, in whose conversation he had formerly
delighted, followed him secretly, in hope of discovering the
cause of his disquiet. Rasselas, who knew not that any one
was near him, having for some time fixed his eyes upon the
goats that were browsing among the rocks, began to compare
their condition with his own.</p>

<p>“What,” said he, “makes the difference between man and
all the rest of the animal creation? Every beast that strays
beside me has the same corporal necessities with myself: he is
hungry and crops the grass, he is thirsty and drinks the stream;
his thirst and hunger are appeased, he is satisfied and sleeps;
he rises again and is hungry; he is again fed and is at rest. I am
hungry and thirsty like him, but when thirst and hunger cease
I am not at rest; I am like him pained with want, but am not
like him satisfied with fullness. The intermediate hours are
tedious and gloomy; I long again to be hungry, that I may
again quicken my attention. The birds peck the berries or the
corn, and fly away to the groves, where they sit in seeming
happiness on the branches, and waste their lives in tuning one
unvaried series of sounds. I likewise can call the lutanist and
the singer; but the sounds that pleased me yesterday weary me
to-day, and will grow yet more wearisome to-morrow. I can
discover within me no power of perception which is not glutted
with its proper pleasure; yet I do not feel myself delighted.
Man surely has some latent sense for which this place affords
no gratification; or he has some desires distinct from sense,
which must be satisfied before he can be happy.”</p>

<p>After this he lifted up his head, and seeing the moon rising,
walked towards the palace. As he passed through the fields,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and saw the animals around him, “Ye,” said he, “are happy,
and need not envy me that walk thus among you, burdened
with myself; nor do I, ye gentle beings, envy your felicity, for
it is not the felicity of man. I have many distresses from
which ye are free; I fear pain when I do not feel it; I sometimes
shrink at evils recollected, and sometimes start at evils
anticipated: surely the equity of providence has balanced
peculiar sufferings with peculiar enjoyments.”</p>

<p>With observations like these the prince amused himself as
he returned, uttering them with a plaintive voice, yet with a
look that discovered him to feel some complacence in his own
perspicacity, and to receive some solace of the miseries of life,
from consciousness of the delicacy with which he felt, and
the eloquence with which he bewailed them. He mingled cheerfully
in the diversions of the evening, and all rejoiced to find
that his heart was lightened.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING</span></h3>

<p>On the next day, his old instructor, imagining that he had now
made himself acquainted with his disease of mind, was in hope
of curing it by counsel, and officiously sought an opportunity
of conference, which the prince, having long considered him as
one whose intellects were exhausted, was not very willing to
afford. “Why,” said he, “does this man thus intrude upon
me? shall I be never suffered to forget those lectures which
pleased only while they were new, and to become new again
must be forgotten?” He then walked into the wood, and
composed himself to his usual meditations; when, before his
thoughts had taken any settled form, he perceived his pursuer
at his side, and was at first prompted by his impatience to go
hastily away; but, being unwilling to offend a man whom he
had once reverenced and still loved, he invited him to sit down
with him on the bank.</p>

<p>The old man, thus encouraged, began to lament the change
which had been lately observed in the prince, and to inquire
why he so often retired from the pleasures of the palace to
loneliness and silence. “I fly from pleasure,” said the prince,
“because pleasure has ceased to please; I am lonely, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I am miserable, and am unwilling to cloud with my presence
the happiness of others.” “You, sir,” said the sage, “are the
first who has complained of misery in the Happy Valley. I hope
to convince you that your complaints have no real cause. You
are here in full possession of all that the Emperor of Abyssinia
can bestow; here is neither labour to be endured nor danger to
be dreaded, yet here is all that labour or danger can procure
or purchase. Look round and tell me which of your wants is
without supply: if you want nothing, how are you unhappy?”</p>

<p>“That I want nothing,” said the prince, “or that I know
not what I want, is the cause of my complaint; if I had any
known want, I should have a certain wish; that wish would
excite endeavour, and I should not then repine to see the sun
move so slowly towards the western mountain, or lament when
the day breaks and sleep will no longer hide me from myself.
When I see the kids and the lambs chasing one another, I fancy
that I should be happy if I had something to pursue. But
possessing all that I can want, I find one day and one hour
exactly like another, except that the latter is still more tedious
than the former. Let your experience inform me how the day
may now seem as short as in my childhood, while nature was
yet fresh, and every moment showed me what I never had
observed before. I have already enjoyed too much; give me
something to desire.”</p>

<p>The old man was surprised at this new species of affliction,
and knew not what to reply, yet was unwilling to be silent.
“Sir,” said he, “if you had seen the miseries of the world, you
would know how to value your present state.” “Now,” said
the prince, “you have given me something to desire; I shall
long to see the miseries of the world, since the sight of them
is necessary to happiness.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE</span></h3>

<p>At this time the sound of music proclaimed the hour of repast,
and the conversation was concluded. The old man went away
sufficiently discontented to find that his reasonings had produced
the only conclusion which they were intended to prevent.
But in the decline of life shame and grief are of short duration:
whether it be that we bear easily what we have borne long;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or that, finding ourselves in age less regarded, we less regard
others; or, that we look with slight regard upon afflictions to
which we know that the hand of death is about to put an end.</p>

<p>The prince, whose views were extended to a wider space,
could not speedily quiet his emotions. He had been before
terrified at the length of life which nature promised him,
because he considered that in a long time much must be
endured; he now rejoiced in his youth, because in many years
much might be done.</p>

<p>This first beam of hope that had been ever darted into his
mind, rekindled youth in his cheeks, and doubled the lustre
of his eyes. He was fired with the desire of doing something,
though he knew not yet with distinctness either end or means.</p>

<p>He was now no longer gloomy and unsocial; but, considering
himself as master of a secret stock of happiness, which he could
enjoy only by concealing it, he affected to be busy in all schemes
of diversion, and endeavoured to make others pleased with the
state of which he himself was weary. But pleasures never
can be so multiplied or continued, as not to leave much of
life unemployed; there were many hours, both of the night and
day, which he could spend without suspicion in solitary thought.
The load of life was much lightened: he went eagerly into the
assemblies, because he supposed the frequency of his presence
necessary to the success of his purposes; he retired gladly to
privacy, because he had now a subject of thought.</p>

<p>His chief amusement was to picture to himself that world
which he had never seen; to place himself in various conditions,
to be entangled in imaginary difficulties, and to be engaged in
wild adventures; but his benevolence always terminated his
projects in the relief of distress, the detection of fraud, the
defeat of oppression, and the diffusion of happiness.</p>

<p>Thus passed twenty months of the life of Rasselas. He
busied himself so intensely in visionary bustle, that he forgot
his real solitude, and, amidst hourly preparations for the various
incidents of human affairs, neglected to consider by what means
he should mingle with mankind.</p>

<p>One day, as he was sitting on a bank, he feigned to himself an
orphan virgin robbed of her little portion by a treacherous
lover, and crying after him for restitution and redress. So
strongly was the image impressed upon his mind, that he
started up in the maid’s defence, and run forward to seize the
plunderer, with all the eagerness of real pursuit. Fear naturally
quickens the flight of guilt. Rasselas could not catch the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fugitive with his utmost efforts; but resolving to weary by
perseverance him whom he could not surpass in speed, he
pressed on till the foot of the mountain stopped his course.</p>

<p>Here he recollected himself, and smiled at his own useless
impetuosity. Then raising his eyes to the mountain, “This,”
said he, “is the fatal obstacle that hinders at once the enjoyment
of pleasure, and the exercise of virtue. How long is it
that my hopes and wishes have flown beyond this boundary of
my life, which yet I never have attempted to surmount!”</p>

<p>Struck with this reflection, he sat down to muse; and remembered,
that since he first resolved to escape from his confinement,
the sun had passed twice over him in his annual course. He
now felt a degree of regret with which he had never been before
acquainted. He considered how much might have been done
in the time which had passed and left nothing real behind it.
He compared twenty months with the life of man. “In life,”
said he, “is not to be counted the ignorance of infancy, or
imbecility of age. We are long before we are able to think,
and we soon cease from the power of acting. The true period
of human existence may be reasonably estimated at forty
years, of which I have mused away the four-and-twentieth part.
What I have lost was certain, for I have certainly possessed it;
but of twenty months to come who can assure me?”</p>

<p>The consciousness of his own folly pierced him deeply, and
he was long before he could be reconciled to himself. “The
rest of my time,” said he, “has been lost by the crime or folly
of my ancestors, and the absurd institutions of my country; I
remember it with disgust, yet without remorse: but the months
that have passed since new light darted into my soul, since
I formed a scheme of reasonable felicity, have been squandered
by my own fault. I have lost that which can never be restored;
I have seen the sun rise and set for twenty months, an idle
gazer on the light of heaven: in this time the birds have left
the nest of their mother, and committed themselves to the
woods and to the skies; the kid has forsaken the teat, and
learned by degrees to climb the rocks in quest of independent
sustenance. I only have made no advances, but am still helpless
and ignorant. The moon, by more than twenty changes,
admonished me of the flux of life; the stream that rolled before
my feet upbraided my inactivity. I sat feasting on intellectual
luxury, regardless alike of the examples of the earth, and
the instructions of the planets. Twenty months are passed;
who shall restore them?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
These sorrowful meditations fastened upon his mind; he
passed four months in resolving to lose no more time in idle
resolves, and was awakened to more vigorous exertion, by
hearing a maid, who had broken a porcelain cup, remark, that
what cannot be repaired is not to be regretted.</p>

<p>This was obvious; and Rasselas reproached himself that he
had not discovered it; having not known, or not considered,
how many useful hints are obtained by chance, and how often
the mind, hurried by her own ardour to distant views, neglects
the truths that lie open before her. He for a few hours regretted
his regret, and from that time bent his whole mind upon the
means of escaping from the Valley of Happiness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE</span></h3>

<p>He now found that it would be very difficult to effect that
which it was very easy to suppose effected. When he looked
round about him, he saw himself confined by the bars of nature,
which had never yet been broken, and by the gate, through
which none that once had passed it were ever able to return.
He was now impatient as an eagle in a grate. He passed week
after week in clambering the mountains, to see if there was
any aperture which the bushes might conceal, but found all
the summits inaccessible by their prominence. The iron gate
he despaired to open; for it was not only secured with all the
power of art, but was always watched by successive sentinels,
and was by its position exposed to the perpetual observation
of all the inhabitants.</p>

<p>He then examined the cavern through which the waters of
the lake were discharged; and, looking down at a time when the
sun shone strongly upon its mouth, he discovered it to be full
of broken rocks, which, though they permitted the stream to
flow through many narrow passages, would stop any body of
solid bulk. He returned discouraged and dejected; but having
now known the blessing of hope, resolved never to despair.</p>

<p>In these fruitless searches he spent ten months. The time,
however, passed cheerfully away: in the morning he rose with
new hope, in the evening applauded his own diligence, and in
the night slept sound after his fatigue. He met a thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
amusements which beguiled his labour and diversified his
thoughts. He discerned the various instincts of animals and
properties of plants, and found the place replete with wonders,
of which he purposed to solace himself with the contemplation,
if he should never be able to accomplish his flight; rejoicing
that his endeavours, though yet unsuccessful, had supplied
him with a source of inexhaustible inquiry.</p>

<p>But his original curiosity was not yet abated; he resolved to
obtain some knowledge of the ways of men. His wish still
continued, but his hope grew less. He ceased to survey any
longer the walls of his prison, and spared to search by new
toils for interstices which he knew could not be found, yet
determined to keep his design always in view, and lay hold on
any expedient that time should offer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING</span></h3>

<p>Among the artists that had been allured into the Happy Valley,
to labour for the accommodation and pleasure of its inhabitants,
was a man eminent for his knowledge of the mechanic powers,
who had contrived many engines both of use and recreation.
By a wheel which the stream turned, he forced the water into
a tower, whence it was distributed to all the apartments of
the palace. He erected a pavilion in the garden, around which
he kept the air always cool by artificial showers. One of the
groves, appropriated to the ladies, was ventilated by fans, to
which the rivulet that run through it gave a constant motion;
and instruments of soft music were placed at proper distances,
of which some played by the impulse of the wind, and some
by the power of the stream.</p>

<p>This artist was sometimes visited by Rasselas, who was pleased
with every kind of knowledge, imagining that the time would
come when all his acquisitions should be of use to him in the
open world. He came one day to amuse himself in his usual
manner, and found the master busy in building a sailing chariot;
he saw that the design was practicable upon a level surface,
and with expressions of great esteem solicited its completion.
The workman was pleased to find himself so much regarded by
the prince, and resolved to gain yet higher honours. “Sir,”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
said he, “you have seen but a small part of what the mechanic
sciences can perform. I have been long of opinion, that instead
of the tardy conveyance of ships and chariots, man might use
the swifter migration of wings; that the fields of air are open
to knowledge, and that only ignorance and idleness need crawl
upon the ground.”</p>

<p>This hint rekindled the prince’s desire of passing the mountains;
having seen what the mechanist had already performed,
he was willing to fancy that he could do more; yet resolved to
inquire further, before he suffered hope to afflict him by disappointment.
“I am afraid,” said he to the artist, “that your
imagination prevails over your skill, and that you now tell me
rather what you wish, than what you know. Every animal
has his element assigned him; the birds have the air, and man
and beasts the earth.” “So,” replied the mechanist, “fishes
have the water, in which yet beasts can swim by nature, and
men by art. He that can swim needs not despair to fly; to
swim is to fly in a grosser fluid, and to fly is to swim in a subtler.
We are only to proportion our power of resistance to the
different density of matter through which we are to pass. You
will be necessarily upborn by the air, if you can renew any impulse
upon it faster than the air can recede from the pressure.”</p>

<p>“But the exercise of swimming,” said the prince, “is very
laborious; the strongest limbs are soon wearied: I am afraid the
act of flying will be yet more violent; and wings will be of no
great use, unless we can fly further than we can swim.”</p>

<p>“The labour of rising from the ground,” said the artist, “will
be great, as we see it in the heavier domestic fowls; but as
we mount higher, the earth’s attraction, and the body’s gravity,
will be gradually diminished, till we shall arrive at a region
where the man will float in the air without any tendency to
fall: no care will then be necessary but to move forwards, which
the gentlest impulse will effect. You, sir, whose curiosity is
so extensive, will easily conceive with what pleasure a philosopher,
furnished with wings, and hovering in the sky, would
see the earth, and all its inhabitants, rolling beneath him, and
presenting to him successively, by its diurnal motion, all the
countries within the same parallel. How must it amuse the
pendent spectator to see the moving scene of land and ocean,
cities and deserts! To survey with equal security the marts
of trade, and the fields of battle; mountains infested by barbarians,
and fruitful regions gladdened by plenty and lulled by
peace! How easily shall we then trace the Nile through all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his passage; pass over to distant regions, and examine the face
of nature from one extremity of the earth to the other!”</p>

<p>“All this,” said the prince, “is much to be desired; but I
am afraid that no man will be able to breathe in these regions
of speculation and tranquillity. I have been told that respiration
is difficult upon lofty mountains; yet from these precipices,
though so high as to produce great tenuity of air, it is very easy
to fall; therefore I suspect that, from any height where life can
be supported, there may be danger of too quick descent.”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied the artist, “will ever be attempted, if all
possible objections must be first overcome. If you will favour
my project, I will try the first flight at my own hazard. I have
considered the structure of all volant animals, and find the
folding continuity of the bat’s wings most easily accommodated
to the human form. Upon this model I shall begin my task
to-morrow, and in a year expect to tower into the air beyond
the malice and pursuit of man. But I will work only on this
condition, that the art shall not be divulged, and that you shall
not require me to make wings for any but ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Rasselas, “should you envy others so great an
advantage? All skill ought to be exerted for universal good;
every man has owed much to others, and ought to repay the
kindness that he has received.”</p>

<p>“If men were all virtuous,” returned the artist, “I should
with great alacrity teach them all to fly. But what would be
the security of the good, if the bad could at pleasure invade
them from the sky? Against an army sailing through the
clouds, neither walls, nor mountains, nor seas, could afford any
security. A flight of northern savages might hover in the
wind, and light at once with irresistible violence upon the
capital of a fruitful region that was rolling under them. Even
this valley, the retreat of princes, the abode of happiness, might
be violated by the sudden descent of some of the naked nations
that swarm on the coast of the southern sea.”</p>

<p>The prince promised secrecy, and waited for the performance,
not wholly hopeless of success. He visited the work from time
to time, observed its progress, and remarked many ingenious
contrivances to facilitate motion, and unite levity with strength.
The artist was every day more certain that he should leave
vultures and eagles behind him, and the contagion of his
confidence seized upon the prince.</p>

<p>In a year the wings were finished; and, on a morning appointed,
the maker appeared furnished for flight on a little promontory:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he waved his pinions awhile to gather air, then leaped from his
stand, and in an instant dropped into the lake. His wings,
which were of no use in the air, sustained him in the water, and
the prince drew him to land, half dead with terror and vexation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING</span></h3>

<p>The prince was not much afflicted by this disaster, having
suffered himself to hope for a happier event, only because he had
no other means of escape in view. He still persisted in his
design to leave the Happy Valley by the first opportunity.</p>

<p>His imagination was now at a stand; he had no prospect of
entering into the world; and, notwithstanding all his endeavours
to support himself, discontent by degrees preyed upon him,
and he began again to lose his thoughts in sadness when the
rainy season, which in these countries is periodical, made it
inconvenient to wander in the woods.</p>

<p>The rain continued longer and with more violence than had
been ever known; the clouds broke on the surrounding mountains,
and the torrents streamed into the plain on every side,
till the cavern was too narrow to discharge the water. The
lake overflowed its banks, and all the level of the valley was
covered with the inundation. The eminence on which the
palace was built, and some other spots of rising ground, were
all that the eye could now discover. The herds and flocks left
the pastures, and both the wild beasts and the tame retreated
to the mountains.</p>

<p>This inundation confined all the princes to domestic amusements;
and the attention of Rasselas was particularly seized by
a poem, which Imlac rehearsed, upon the various conditions of
humanity. He commanded the poet to attend him in his
apartment, and recite his verses a second time; then entering
into familiar talk, he thought himself happy in having found
a man who knew the world so well, and could so skilfully paint
the scenes of life. He asked a thousand questions about things,
to which, though common to all other mortals, his confinement
from childhood had kept him a stranger. The poet pitied his
ignorance, and loved his curiosity, and entertained him from
day to day with novelty and instruction, so that the prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
regretted the necessity of sleep, and longed till the morning
should renew his pleasure.</p>

<p>As they were sitting together, the prince commanded Imlac
to relate his history, and to tell by what accident he was forced,
or by what motive induced, to close his life in the Happy Valley.
As he was going to begin his narrative, Rasselas was called to a
concert, and obliged to restrain his curiosity till the evening.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE HISTORY OF IMLAC</span></h3>

<p>The close of the day is, in the regions of the torrid zone, the
only season of diversion and entertainment, and it was therefore
midnight before the music ceased, and the princesses retired.
Rasselas then called for his companion, and required him to
begin the story of his life.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Imlac, “my history will not be long: the life that
is devoted to knowledge passes silently away, and is very little
diversified by events. To talk in public, to think in solitude,
to read and to hear, to inquire and answer inquiries, is the
business of a scholar. He wanders about the world without
pomp or terror, and is neither known nor valued but by
men like himself.</p>

<p>“I was born in the kingdom of Goiama, at no great distance
from the fountain of the Nile. My father was a wealthy merchant,
who traded between the inland countries of Afric and
the ports of the Red Sea. He was honest, frugal, and diligent,
but of mean sentiments and narrow comprehension: he desired
only to be rich, and to conceal his riches, lest he should be
spoiled by the governor of the province.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the prince, “my father must be negligent of
his charge, if any man in his dominions dares take that which
belongs to another. Does he not know that kings are accountable
for injustice as well as done? If I were emperour, not the
meanest of my subjects should be oppressed with impunity.
My blood boils when I am told that a merchant durst not enjoy
his honest gains, for fear of losing them by the rapacity of
power. Name the governor who robbed the people, that I
may declare his crimes to the emperor.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Imlac, “your ardour is the natural effect of virtue
animated by youth: the time will come when you will acquit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
your father, and perhaps hear with less impatience of the
governor. Oppression is, in the Abyssinian dominions, neither
frequent nor tolerated; but no form of government has been
yet discovered, by which cruelty can be wholly prevented.
Subordination supposes power in one part, and subjection on
the other; and if power be in the hands of men, it will sometimes
be abused. The vigilance of the supreme magistrate
may do much, but much will still remain undone. He can
never know all the crimes that are committed, and can seldom
punish all that he knows.”</p>

<p>“This,” said the prince, “I do not understand; but I had rather
hear thee than dispute. Continue thy narration.”</p>

<p>“My father,” proceeded Imlac, “originally intended that I
should have no other education than such as might qualify
me for commerce; and discovering in me great strength of
memory and quickness of apprehension, often declared his hope
that I should be some time the richest man in Abyssinia.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the prince, “did thy father desire the increase
of his wealth, when it was already greater than he durst discover
or enjoy? I am unwilling to doubt thy veracity, yet inconsistencies
cannot both be true.”</p>

<p>“Inconsistencies,” answered Imlac, “cannot both be right,
but, imputed to man, they may both be true. Yet diversity
is not inconsistency. My father might expect a time of greater
security. However, some desire is necessary to keep life in
motion; and he whose real wants are supplied must admit
those of fancy.”</p>

<p>“This,” said the prince, “I can in some measure conceive.
I repent that I interrupted thee.”</p>

<p>“With this hope,” proceeded Imlac, “he sent me to school;
but when I had once found the delight of knowledge, and felt
the pleasure of intelligence and the pride of invention, I began
silently to despise riches, and determined to disappoint the
purpose of my father, whose grossness of conception raised my
pity. I was twenty years old before his tenderness would
expose me to the fatigue of travel, in which time I had been
instructed, by successive masters, in all the literature of my
native country. As every hour taught me something new, I
lived in a continual course of gratifications; but, as I advanced
towards manhood, I lost much of the reverence with which I
had been used to look on my instructors; because, when the
lesson was ended, I did not find them wiser or better than
common men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“At length my father resolved to initiate me in commerce,
and opening one of his subterranean treasuries, counted out
ten thousand pieces of gold. ‘This, young man,’ said he, ‘is
the stock with which you must negotiate. I began with less
than the fifth part, and you see how diligence and parsimony
have increased it. This is your own to waste or to improve.
If you squander it by negligence or caprice, you must wait for
my death before you will be rich; if in four years you double
your stock, we will thenceforward let subordination cease, and
live together as friends and partners; for he shall always be equal
with me, who is equally skilled in the art of growing rich.’</p>

<p>“We laid our money upon camels, concealed in bales of
cheap goods, and travelled to the shore of the Red Sea. When
I cast my eye on the expanse of waters, my heart bounded like
that of a prisoner escaped. I felt an unextinguishable curiosity
kindle in my mind, and resolved to snatch this opportunity of
seeing the manners of other nations, and of learning sciences
unknown in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>“I remembered that my father had obliged me to the improvement
of my stock, not by a promise which I ought not to violate,
but by a penalty which I was at liberty to incur; and therefore
determined to gratify my predominant desire, and, by drinking
at the fountains of knowledge, to quench the thirst of curiosity.</p>

<p>“As I was supposed to trade without connexion with my
father, it was easy for me to become acquainted with the master
of a ship, and procure a passage to some other country. I had
no motives of choice to regulate my voyage; it was sufficient for
me that, wherever I wandered, I should see a country which
I had not seen before. I therefore entered a ship bound for
Surat, having left a letter for my father declaring my intention.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE HISTORY OF IMLAC CONTINUED</span></h3>

<p>“When I first entered upon the world of waters, and lost sight
of land, I looked round about me with pleasing terror, and
thinking my soul enlarged by the boundless prospect, imagined
that I could gaze round for ever without satiety; but in a short
time I grew weary of looking on barren uniformity, where I
could only see again what I had already seen. I then descended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
into the ship, and doubted for a while whether all my future
pleasures would not end like this, in disgust and disappointment.
Yet, surely, said I, the ocean and the land are very different;
the only variety of water is rest and motion, but the earth has
mountains and valleys, deserts and cities; it is inhabited by men
of different customs and contrary opinions; and I may hope
to find variety in life, though I should miss it in nature.</p>

<p>“With this thought I quieted my mind; and amused myself
during the voyage, sometimes by learning from the sailors the
art of navigation, which I have never practised, and sometimes
by forming schemes for my conduct in different situations,
in not one of which I have been ever placed.</p>

<p>“I was almost weary of my naval amusements when we
landed safely at Surat. I secured my money, and purchasing
some commodities for show, joined myself to a caravan that
was passing into the inland country. My companions, for some
reason or other conjecturing that I was rich, and, by my
inquiries and admiration, finding that I was ignorant, considered
me as a novice whom they had a right to cheat, and
who was to learn at the usual expense the art of fraud. They
exposed me to the theft of servants and the exaction of officers,
and saw me plundered upon false pretences, without any
advantage to themselves, but that of rejoicing in the superiority
of their own knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment,” said the prince. “Is there such depravity
in man, as that he should injure another without benefit to himself?
I can easily conceive that all are pleased with superiority;
but your ignorance was merely accidental, which, being neither
your crime nor your folly, could afford them no reason to
applaud themselves; and the knowledge which they had, and
which you wanted, they might as effectually have shown by
warning as betraying you.”</p>

<p>“Pride,” said Imlac, “is seldom delicate, it will please itself
with very mean advantages; and envy feels not its own happiness,
but when it may be compared with the misery of others.
They were my enemies, because they grieved to think me rich;
and my oppressors, because they delighted to find me weak.”</p>

<p>“Proceed,” said the prince: “I doubt not of the facts which
you relate, but imagine that you impute them to mistaken
motives.”</p>

<p>“In this company,” said Imlac, “I arrived at Agra, the
capital of Indostan, the city in which the Great Mogul commonly
resides. I applied myself to the language of the country, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in a few months was able to converse with the learned men;
some of whom I found morose and reserved, and others easy
and communicative; some were unwilling to teach another
what they had with difficulty learned themselves; and some
showed that the end of their studies was to gain the dignity
of instructing.</p>

<p>“To the tutor of the young princes I recommended myself
so much, that I was presented to the emperor as a man of
uncommon knowledge. The emperor asked me many questions
concerning my country and my travels; and though I cannot now
recollect anything that he uttered above the power of a common
man, he dismissed me astonished at his wisdom, and enamoured
of his goodness.</p>

<p>“My credit was now so high, that the merchants with whom
I had travelled applied to me for recommendations to the
ladies of the court. I was surprised at their confidence of
solicitation, and gently reproached them with their practices
on the road. They heard me with cold indifference, and showed
no tokens of shame or sorrow.</p>

<p>“They then urged their request with the offer of a bribe;
but what I would not do for kindness, I would not do for money,
and refused them, not because they had injured me, but because
I would not enable them to injure others; for I knew they would
have made use of my credit to cheat those who should buy
their wares.</p>

<p>“Having resided at Agra till there was no more to be learned,
I travelled into Persia, where I saw many remains of ancient
magnificence, and observed many new accommodations of life.
The Persians are a nation eminently social, and their assemblies
afforded me daily opportunities of remarking characters and
manners, and of tracing human nature through all its variations.</p>

<p>“From Persia I passed into Arabia, where I saw a nation
at once pastoral and warlike; who live without any settled
habitation; whose only wealth is their flocks and herds; and
who have yet carried on through all ages an hereditary war
with all mankind, though they neither covet nor envy their
possessions.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br /><br />
<span class="sub">IMLAC’S HISTORY CONTINUED. A DISSERTATION UPON POETRY</span></h3>

<p>“Wherever I went, I found that poetry was considered as the
highest learning, and regarded with a veneration somewhat
approaching to that which man would pay to the Angelic
Nature. And yet it fills me with wonder, that, in almost all
countries, the most ancient poets are considered as the best:
whether it be that every other kind of knowledge is an acquisition
gradually attained, and poetry is a gift conferred at once; or
that the first poetry of every nation surprised them as a novelty,
and retained the credit by consent, which it received by accident
at first; or whether, as the province of poetry is to describe
Nature and Passion, which are always the same, the first writers
took possession of the most striking objects for description,
and the most probable occurrences for fiction, and left nothing
to those that followed them, but transcription of the same
events, and new combinations of the same images. Whatever
be the reason, it is commonly observed that the early writers
are in possession of nature, and their followers of art; that the
first excel in strength and invention, and the latter in elegance
and refinement.</p>

<p>“I was desirous to add my name to this illustrious fraternity.
I read all the poets of Persia and Arabia, and was able to repeat
by memory the volumes that are suspended in the mosque of
Mecca. But I soon found that no man was ever great by
imitation. My desire of excellence impelled me to transfer my
attention to nature and to life. Nature was to be my subject,
and men to be my auditors: I could never describe what I had
not seen; I could not hope to move those with delight or terror,
whose interests and opinions I did not understand.</p>

<p>“Being now resolved to be a poet, I saw everything with
a new purpose; my sphere of attention was suddenly magnified;
no kind of knowledge was to be overlooked. I ranged mountains
and deserts for images and resemblances, and pictured
upon my mind every tree of the forest and flower of the valley.
I observed with equal care the crags of the rock and the pinnacles
of the palace. Sometimes I wandered along the mazes of the
rivulet, and sometimes watched the changes of the summer
clouds. To a poet nothing can be useless. Whatever is beautiful,
and whatever is dreadful, must be familiar to his imagination:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
he must be conversant with all that is awfully vast or elegantly
little. The plants of the garden, the animals of the wood, the
minerals of the earth, and meteors of the sky, must all concur
to store his mind with inexhaustible variety: for every idea is
useful for the enforcement or decoration of moral or religious
truth; and he who knows most will have most power of
diversifying his scenes, and of gratifying his reader with remote
allusions and unexpected instruction.</p>

<p>“All the appearances of nature I was therefore careful to study;
and every country which I have surveyed has contributed something
to my poetical powers.”</p>

<p>“In so wide a survey,” said the prince, “you must surely
have left much unobserved. I have lived, till now, within
the circuit of these mountains, and yet cannot walk abroad
without the sight of something which I had never beheld
before, or never heeded.”</p>

<p>“The business of a poet,” said Imlac, “is to examine, not
the individual, but the species; to remark general properties
and large appearances. He does not number the streaks of the
tulip, or describe the different shades in the verdure of the
forest: he is to exhibit in his portraits of nature such prominent
and striking features, as recall the original to every mind; and
must neglect the minuter discriminations, which one may have
remarked, and another have neglected, for those characteristics
which are alike obvious to vigilance and carelessness.</p>

<p>“But the knowledge of nature is only half the task of a poet:
he must be acquainted likewise with all the modes of life. His
character requires that he estimate the happiness and misery of
every condition, observe the power of all the passions in all
their combinations, and trace the changes of the human mind
as they are modified by various institutions and accidental
influences of climate or custom, from the sprightliness of infancy
to the despondence of decrepitude. He must divest himself
of the prejudices of his age and country; he must consider right
and wrong in their abstracted and invariable state; he must
disregard present laws and opinions, and rise to general and
transcendental truths, which will always be the same. He must
therefore content himself with the slow progress of his name,
contemn the applause of his own time, and commit his claims
to the justice of posterity. He must write as the interpreter
of nature, and the legislator of mankind, and consider himself as
presiding over the thoughts and manners of future generations;
as a being superior to time and place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
“His labour is not yet at an end; he must know many languages
and many sciences; and, that his style may be worthy of his
thoughts, must, by incessant practice, familiarize to himself every
delicacy of speech and grace of harmony.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">IMLAC’S NARRATIVE CONTINUED. A HINT ON PILGRIMAGE</span></h3>

<p>Imlac now felt the enthusiastic fit, and was proceeding to
aggrandize his own profession, when the prince cried out,
“Enough! thou hast convinced me that no human being can
ever be a poet. Proceed with thy narration.”</p>

<p>“To be a poet,” said Imlac, “is indeed very difficult.”</p>

<p>“So difficult,” returned the prince, “that I will at present
hear no more of his labours. Tell me whither you went when
you had seen Persia.”</p>

<p>“From Persia,” said the poet, “I travelled through Syria,
and for three years resided in Palestine, where I conversed with
great numbers of the northern and western nations of Europe;
the nations which are now in possession of all power and all
knowledge; whose armies are irresistible, and whose fleets
command the remotest parts of the globe. When I compared
these men with the natives of our own kingdom, and those
that surround us, they appeared almost another order of beings.
In their countries it is difficult to wish for anything that may
not be obtained: a thousand arts, of which we never heard,
are continually labouring for their convenience and pleasure;
and whatever their own climate has denied them is supplied
by their commerce.”</p>

<p>“By what means,” said the prince, “are the Europeans thus
powerful? or why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa
for trade or conquest, cannot the Asiatics and Africans invade
their coasts, plant colonies in their ports, and give laws to their
natural princes? The same wind that carries them back
would bring us thither.”</p>

<p>“They are more powerful, sir, than we,” answered Imlac,
“because they are wiser; knowledge will always predominate
over ignorance, as man governs the other animals. But why
their knowledge is more than ours, I know not what reason can
be given, but the unsearchable will of the Supreme Being.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“When,” said the prince with a sigh, “shall I be able to visit
Palestine, and mingle with this mighty confluence of nations?
Till that happy moment shall arrive, let me fill up the time with
such representations as thou canst give me. I am not ignorant
of the motive that assembles such numbers in that place, and
cannot but consider it as the centre of wisdom and piety, to
which the best and wisest men of every land must be continually
resorting.”</p>

<p>“There are some nations,” said Imlac, “that send few visitants
to Palestine; for many numerous and learned sects in Europe
concur to censure pilgrimage as superstitious, or deride it as
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“You know,” said the prince, “how little my life has made
me acquainted with diversity of opinions; it will be too long to
hear the arguments on both sides; you, that have considered
them, tell me the result.”</p>

<p>“Pilgrimage,” said Imlac, “like many other acts of piety,
may be reasonable or superstitious, according to the principles
upon which it is performed. Long journeys in search of truth
are not commanded. Truth, such as is necessary to the regulation
of life, is always found where it is honestly sought. Change
of place is no natural cause of the increase of piety, for it inevitably
produces dissipation of mind. Yet, since men go every
day to view the fields where great actions have been performed,
and return with stronger impressions of the event, curiosity
of the same kind may naturally dispose us to view that country
whence our religion had its beginning; and I believe no man
surveys those awful scenes without some confirmation of holy
resolutions. That the Supreme Being may be more easily
propitiated in one place than in another, is the dream of idle
superstition; but that some places may operate upon our own
minds in an uncommon manner, is an opinion which hourly
experience will justify. He who supposes that his vices may be
more successfully combated in Palestine, will, perhaps, find
himself mistaken; yet he may go thither without folly: he who
thinks they will be more freely pardoned, dishonours at once his
reason and religion.”</p>

<p>“These,” said the prince, “are European distinctions. I will
consider them another time. What have you found to be the
effect of knowledge? Are those nations happier than we?”</p>

<p>“There is so much infelicity,” said the poet, “in the world,
that scarce any man has leisure from his own distresses to
estimate the comparative happiness of others. Knowledge is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
certainly one of the means of pleasure, as is confessed by the
natural desire which every mind feels of increasing its ideas.
Ignorance is mere privation, by which nothing can be produced:
it is a vacuity in which the soul sits motionless and torpid for
want of attraction; and without knowing why, we always
rejoice when we learn, and grieve when we forget. I am therefore
inclined to conclude, that if nothing counteracts the natural
consequence of learning, we grow more happy as our minds
take a wider range.</p>

<p>“In enumerating the particular comforts of life, we shall
find many advantages on the side of the Europeans. They
cure wounds and diseases with which we languish and perish.
We suffer inclemencies of weather which they can obviate.
They have engines for the dispatch of many laborious works,
which we must perform by manual industry. There is such
communication between distant places, that one friend can
hardly be said to be absent from another. Their policy removes
all public inconveniences; they have roads cut through their
mountains, and bridges laid upon their rivers. And, if we
descend to the privacies of life, their habitations are more
commodious, and their possessions are more secure.”</p>

<p>“They are surely happy,” said the prince, “who have all these
conveniences, of which I envy none so much as the facility with
which separated friends interchange their thoughts.”</p>

<p>“The Europeans,” answered Imlac, “are less unhappy than
we; but they are not happy. Human life is everywhere a
state in which much is to be endured, and little to be enjoyed.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE STORY OF IMLAC CONTINUED</span></h3>

<p>“I am not yet willing,” said the prince, “to suppose that
happiness is so parsimoniously distributed to mortals; nor can
believe but that, if I had the choice of life, I should be able
to fill every day with pleasure. I would injure no man, and
should provoke no resentment; I would relieve every distress,
and should enjoy the benedictions of gratitude. I would choose
my friends among the wise, and my wife among the virtuous;
and therefore should be in no danger from treachery or unkindness.
My children should, by my care, be learned and pious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and would repay to my age what their childhood had received.
What would dare to molest him who might call on every side
to thousands enriched by his bounty, or assisted by his power?
And why should not life glide quietly away in the soft reciprocation
of protection and reverence? All this may be done without
the help of European refinements, which appear by their effects
to be rather specious than useful. Let us leave them, and
pursue our journey.”</p>

<p>“From Palestine,” said Imlac, “I passed through many
regions of Asia; in the more civilized kingdoms as a trader,
and among the barbarians of the mountains as a pilgrim. At
last I began to long for my native country, that I might repose,
after my travels and fatigues, in the places where I had spent
my earliest years, and gladden my old companions with the
recital of my adventures. Often did I figure to myself those
with whom I had sported away the gay hours of dawning life,
sitting round me in its evening, wondering at my tales, and
listening to my counsels.</p>

<p>“When this thought had taken possession of my mind, I
considered every moment as wasted which did not bring me
nearer to Abyssinia. I hastened into Egypt, and, notwithstanding
my impatience, was detained ten months in the contemplation
of its ancient magnificence, and in inquiries after
the remains of its ancient learning. I found in Cairo a mixture
of all nations; some brought thither by the love of knowledge,
some by the hope of gain, and many by the desire of living
after their own manner without observation, and of lying hid
in the obscurity of multitudes: for in a city, populous as Cairo,
it is possible to obtain at the same time the gratifications of
society, and the secrecy of solitude.</p>

<p>“From Cairo I travelled to Suez, and embarked on the Red
Sea, passing along the coast till I arrived at the port from which
I had departed twenty years before. Here I joined myself to
a caravan, and re-entered my native country.</p>

<p>“I now expected the caresses of my kinsmen, and the congratulations
of my friends, and was not without hope that my
father, whatever value he had set upon riches, would own with
gladness and pride a son who was able to add to the felicity
and honour of the nation. But I was soon convinced that my
thoughts were vain. My father had been dead fourteen years,
having divided his wealth among my brothers, who were removed
to some other provinces. Of my companions, the
greater part was in the grave; of the rest, some could with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
difficulty remember me, and some considered me as one
corrupted by foreign manners.</p>

<p>“A man used to vicissitudes is not easily dejected. I forgot,
after a time, my disappointment, and endeavoured to recommend
myself to the nobles of the kingdom; they admitted me
to their tables, heard my story, and dismissed me. I opened
a school, and was prohibited to teach. I then resolved to sit
down in the quiet of domestic life, and addressed a lady that
was fond of my conversation, but rejected my suit because my
father was a merchant.</p>

<p>“Wearied at last with solicitation and repulses, I resolved to
hide myself for ever from the world, and depend no longer on
the opinion or caprice of others. I waited for the time when
the gate of the Happy Valley should open, that I might bid
farewell to hope and fear: the day came; my performance was
distinguished with favour; and I resigned myself with joy to
perpetual confinement.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou here found happiness at last?” said Rasselas.
“Tell me without reserve; art thou content with thy condition?
or, dost thou wish to be again wandering and inquiring? All
the inhabitants of this valley celebrate their lot, and, at the annual
visit of the emperor, invite others to partake of their felicity.”</p>

<p>“Great prince,” said Imlac, “I shall speak the truth; I know
not one of all your attendants who does not lament the hour
when he entered this retreat. I am less unhappy than the
rest, because I have a mind replete with images, which I can
vary and combine at pleasure. I can amuse my solitude by
the renovation of the knowledge which begins to fade from my
memory, and by recollection of the accidents of my past life.
Yet all this ends in the sorrowful consideration, that my acquirements
are now useless, and that none of my pleasures can be
again enjoyed. The rest, whose minds have no impression but
of the present moment, are either corroded by malignant
passions, or sit stupid in the gloom of perpetual vacancy.”</p>

<p>“What passions can infest those,” said the prince, “who
have no rivals? We are in a place where impotence precludes
malice, and where all envy is repressed by community of
enjoyments.”</p>

<p>“There may be community,” said Imlac, “of material possessions,
but there can never be community of love or of esteem.
It must happen that one will please more than another; he
that knows himself despised will always be envious; and still
more envious and malevolent, if he is condemned to live in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
presence of those who despise him. The invitations by which
they allure others to a state which they feel to be wretched,
proceed from the natural malignity of hopeless misery. They
are weary of themselves and of each other, and expect to find
relief in new companions. They envy the liberty which their
folly has forfeited, and would gladly see all mankind imprisoned
like themselves.</p>

<p>“From this crime, however, I am wholly free. No man can
say that he is wretched by my persuasion. I look with pity
on the crowds who are annually soliciting admission to captivity,
and wish that it were lawful for me to warn them of their
danger.”</p>

<p>“My dear Imlac,” said the prince, “I will open to thee my
whole heart. I have long meditated an escape from the Happy
Valley. I have examined the mountains on every side, but
find myself insuperably barred: teach me the way to break my
prison; thou shalt be the companion of my flight, the guide
of my rambles, the partner of my fortune, and my sole director
in the <i>choice of life</i>.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” answered the poet, “your escape will be difficult,
and, perhaps, you may soon repent your curiosity. The world,
which you figure smooth and quiet as the lake in the valley,
you will find a sea foaming with tempests and boiling with
whirlpools: you will be sometimes overwhelmed by the waves
of violence, and sometimes dashed against the rocks of treachery.
Amidst wrongs and frauds, competitions and anxieties, you will
wish a thousand times for these seats of quiet, and willingly
quit hope to be free from fear.”</p>

<p>“Do not seek to deter me from my purpose,” said the prince;
“I am impatient to see what thou hast seen; and, since thou
art thyself weary of the valley, it is evident that thy former
state was better than this. Whatever be the consequence of
my experiment, I am resolved to judge with mine own eyes
of the various conditions of men, and then to make deliberately
my <i>choice of life</i>.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said Imlac, “you are hindered by stronger
restraints than my persuasions; yet, if your determination is
fixed, I do not counsel you to despair. Few things are impossible
to diligence and skill.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE</span></h3>

<p>The prince now dismissed his favourite to rest; but the narrative
of wonders and novelties filled his mind with perturbation.
He revolved all that he had heard, and prepared innumerable
questions for the morning.</p>

<p>Much of his uneasiness was now removed. He had a friend
to whom he could impart his thoughts, and whose experience
could assist him in his designs. His heart was no longer condemned
to swell with silent vexation. He thought that even the
Happy Valley might be endured with such a companion, and
that if they could range the world together, he should have
nothing further to desire.</p>

<p>In a few days the water was discharged, and the ground dried.
The prince and Imlac then walked out together, to converse
without the notice of the rest. The prince, whose thoughts
were always on the wing, as he passed by the gate, said, with
a countenance of sorrow, “Why art thou so strong, and why is
man so weak?”</p>

<p>“Man is not weak,” answered his companion; “knowledge
is more than equivalent to force. The master of mechanics
laughs at strength. I can burst the gate, but cannot do it
secretly. Some other expedient must be tried.”</p>

<p>As they were walking on the side of the mountain, they
observed that the conies, which the rain had driven from their
burrows, had taken shelter among the bushes, and formed holes
behind them, tending upwards in an oblique line. “It has
been the opinion of antiquity,” said Imlac, “that human
reason borrowed many arts from the instinct of animals; let us,
therefore, not think ourselves degraded by learning from the
coney. We may escape by piercing the mountain in the same
direction. We will begin where the summit hangs over the
middle part, and labour upward till we shall issue up beyond
the prominence.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the prince, when he heard this proposal, sparkled
with joy. The execution was easy, and the success certain.</p>

<p>No time was now lost. They hastened early in the morning
to choose a place proper for their mine. They clambered with
great fatigue among crags and brambles, and returned without
having discovered any part that favoured their design. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
second and the third day were spent in the same manner, and
with the same frustration. But, on the fourth, they found a
small cavern, concealed by a thicket, where they resolved to
make their experiment.</p>

<p>Imlac procured instruments proper to hew stone and remove
earth, and they fell to their work on the next day with more
eagerness than vigour. They were presently exhausted by
their efforts, and sat down to pant upon the grass. The prince,
for a moment, appeared to be discouraged. “Sir,” said his
companion, “practice will enable us to continue our labour for
a longer time; mark, however, how far we have advanced, and
you will find that our toil will some time have an end. Great
works are performed, not by strength but perseverance: yonder
palace was raised by single stones, yet you see its height and
spaciousness. He that shall walk with vigour three hours a
day, will pass in seven years a space equal to the circumference
of the globe.”</p>

<p>They returned to their work day after day, and, in a short
time, found a fissure in the rock, which enabled them to pass
far with very little obstruction. This Rasselas considered as a
good omen. “Do not disturb your mind,” said Imlac, “with
other hopes or fears than reason may suggest: if you are pleased
with prognostics of good, you will be terrified likewise with
tokens of evil, and your whole life will be a prey to superstition.
Whatever facilitates our work is more than an omen, it is a
cause of success. This is one of those pleasing surprises which
often happen to active resolution. Many things difficult to
design prove easy to performance.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">RASSELAS AND IMLAC RECEIVE AN UNEXPECTED VISIT</span></h3>

<p>They had now wrought their way to the middle, and solaced
their toil with the approach of liberty, when the prince, coming
down to refresh himself with air, found his sister Nekayah
standing before the mouth of the cavity. He started and stood
confused, afraid to tell his design, and yet hopeless to conceal
it. A few moments determined him to repose on her fidelity,
and secure her secrecy by a declaration without reserve.</p>

<p>“Do not imagine,” said the princess, “that I came hither
as a spy: I had long observed from my window that you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Imlac directed your walk every day towards the same point;
but I did not suppose you had any better reason for the preference
than a cooler shade, or more fragrant bank; nor followed
you with any other design than to partake of your conversation.
Since, then, not suspicion but fondness has detected you, let
me not lose the advantage of my discovery. I am equally
weary of confinement with yourself, and not less desirous of
knowing what is done or suffered in the world. Permit me to
fly with you from this tasteless tranquillity, which will yet grow
more loathsome when you have left me. You may deny me to
accompany you, but cannot hinder me from following.”</p>

<p>The prince, who loved Nekayah above his other sisters, had
no inclination to refuse her request, and grieved that he had
lost an opportunity of showing his confidence by a voluntary
communication. It was therefore agreed that she should leave
the valley with them; and that, in the meantime, she should
watch lest any other straggler should, by chance or curiosity,
follow them to the mountain.</p>

<p>At length their labour was at an end; they saw light beyond
the prominence, and, issuing to the top of the mountain, beheld
the Nile, yet a narrow current, wandering beneath them.</p>

<p>The prince looked round with rapture, anticipated all the
pleasures of travel, and in thought was already transported
beyond his father’s dominions. Imlac, though very joyful at
his escape, had less expectation of pleasure in the world, which
he had before tried, and of which he had been weary.</p>

<p>Rasselas was so much delighted with a wider horizon, that
he could not soon be persuaded to return into the valley. He
informed his sister that the way was open, and that nothing
now remained but to prepare for their departure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS LEAVE THE VALLEY, AND SEE
MANY WONDERS</span></h3>

<p>The prince and princess had jewels sufficient to make them
rich whenever they came into a place of commerce, which,
by Imlac’s direction, they hid in their clothes; and, on the night
of the next full moon, all left the valley. The princess was
followed only by a single favourite, who did not know whither
she was going.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
They clambered through the cavity, and began to go down
on the other side. The princess and her maid turned their
eyes towards every part, and, seeing nothing to bound their
prospect, considered themselves as in danger of being lost in
a dreary vacuity. They stopped and trembled. “I am almost
afraid,” said the princess, “to begin a journey of which I cannot
perceive an end, and to venture into this immense plain, where
I may be approached on every side by men whom I never saw.”
The prince felt nearly the same emotions, though he thought
it more manly to conceal them.</p>

<p>Imlac smiled at their terrors, and encouraged them to
proceed; but the princess continued irresolute till she had
been imperceptibly drawn forward too far to return.</p>

<p>In the morning they found some shepherds in the field, who
set milk and fruits before them. The princess wondered that
she did not see a palace ready for her reception, and a table
spread with delicacies; but being faint and hungry, she drank
the milk and ate the fruits, and thought them of a higher
flavour than the products of the valley.</p>

<p>They travelled forward by easy journeys, being all unaccustomed
to toil or difficulty, and knowing that, though
they might be missed, they could not be pursued. In a few
days they came into a more populous region, where Imlac was
diverted with the admiration which his companions expressed
at the diversity of manners, stations, and employments.</p>

<p>Their dress was such as might not bring upon them the
suspicion of having anything to conceal; yet the prince,
wherever he came, expected to be obeyed, and the princess
was frighted because those that came into her presence did not
prostrate themselves before her. Imlac was forced to observe
them with great vigilance, lest they should betray their rank by
their unusual behaviour, and detained them several weeks in the
first village, to accustom them to the sight of common mortals.</p>

<p>By degrees the royal wanderers were taught to understand
that they had for a time laid aside their dignity, and were
to expect only such regard as liberality and courtesy could
procure. And Imlac having, by many admonitions, prepared
them to endure the tumults of a port, and the ruggedness of
the commercial race, brought them down to the sea-coast.</p>

<p>The prince and his sister, to whom everything was new,
were gratified equally at all places, and therefore remained for
some months at the port, without any inclination to pass further.
Imlac was content with their stay, because he did not think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it safe to expose them, unpractised in the world, to the hazards
of a foreign country.</p>

<p>At last he began to fear lest they should be discovered, and
proposed to fix a day for their departure. They had no pretensions
to judge for themselves, and referred the whole scheme
to his direction. He therefore took passage in a ship to Suez;
and, when the time came, with great difficulty prevailed on the
princess to enter the vessel. They had a quick and prosperous
voyage, and from Suez travelled by land to Cairo.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THEY ENTER CAIRO, AND FIND EVERY MAN HAPPY</span></h3>

<p>As they approached the city, which filled the strangers with
astonishment, “This,” said Imlac to the prince, “is the place
where travellers and merchants assemble from all the corners
of the earth. You will here find men of every character and
every occupation. Commerce is here honourable: I will act
as a merchant, and you shall live as strangers who have no other
end of travel than curiosity; it will soon be observed that we
are rich; our reputation will procure us access to all whom we
shall desire to know; you will see all the conditions of humanity,
and enable yourself at leisure to make your <i>choice of life</i>.”</p>

<p>They now entered the town, stunned by the noise and offended
by the crowds. Instruction had not yet so prevailed over
habit, but that they wondered to see themselves pass undistinguished
along the street, and met by the lowest of the people
without reverence or notice. The princess could not at first
bear the thought of being levelled with the vulgar, and for some
days continued in her chamber, where she was served by her
favourite Pekuah as in the palace of the valley.</p>

<p>Imlac, who understood traffic, sold part of the jewels the
next day, and hired a house, which he adorned with such
magnificence that he was immediately considered as a merchant
of great wealth. His politeness attracted many acquaintance,
and his generosity made him courted by many dependants.
His table was crowded by men of every nation, who all
admired his knowledge and solicited his favour. His companions,
not being able to mix in the conversation, could make
no discovery of their ignorance or surprise, and were gradually
initiated in the world as they gained knowledge of the language.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
The prince had, by frequent lectures, been taught the use
and nature of money; but the ladies could not, for a long time,
comprehend what the merchants did with small pieces of gold
and silver, or why things of so little use should be received as
equivalent to the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>They studied the language two years, while Imlac was preparing
to set before them the various ranks and conditions of
mankind. He grew acquainted with all who had anything
uncommon in their fortune or conduct. He frequented the
voluptuous and the frugal, the idle and the busy, the merchants
and the men of learning.</p>

<p>The prince being now able to converse with fluency, and having
learned the caution necessary to be observed in his intercourse
with strangers, began to accompany Imlac to places of resort,
and to enter into all assemblies, that he might make his <i>choice
of life</i>.</p>

<p>For some time he thought choice needless, because all
appeared to him equally happy. Wherever he went he met
gaiety and kindness, and heard the song of joy or the laugh of
carelessness. He began to believe that the world overflowed
with universal plenty, and that nothing was withheld either
from want or merit; that every hand showered liberality, and
every heart melted with benevolence; “and who then,” says
he, “will be suffered to be wretched?”</p>

<p>Imlac permitted the pleasing delusion, and was unwilling to
crush the hope of inexperience, till one day, having sat awhile
silent, “I know not,” said the prince, “what can be the reason
that I am more unhappy than any of our friends. I see them
perpetually and unalterably cheerful, but feel my own mind
restless and uneasy. I am unsatisfied with those pleasures
which I seem most to court. I live in the crowds of jollity,
not so much to enjoy company as to shun myself, and am only
loud and merry to conceal my sadness.”</p>

<p>“Every man,” said Imlac, “may, by examining his own
mind, guess what passes in the minds of others; when you feel
that your own gaiety is counterfeit, it may justly lead you to
suspect that of your companions not to be sincere. Envy is
commonly reciprocal. We are long before we are convinced
that happiness is never to be found; and each believes it possessed
by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself.
In the assembly where you passed the last night, there
appeared such sprightliness of air and volatility of fancy, as
might have suited beings of a higher order, formed to inhabit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
serener regions inaccessible to care or sorrow; yet, believe me,
prince, there was not one who did not dread the moment when
solitude should deliver him to the tyranny of reflection.”</p>

<p>“This,” said the prince, “may be true of others, since it is
true of me; yet, whatever be the general infelicity of man, one
condition is more happy than another, and wisdom surely
directs us to take the least evil in the <i>choice of life</i>.”</p>

<p>“The causes of good and evil,” answered Imlac, “are so
various and uncertain, so often entangled with each other, so
diversified by various relations, and so much subject to accidents
which cannot be foreseen, that he who would fix his condition
upon incontestable reasons of preference must live and die
inquiring and deliberating.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” said Rasselas, “the wise men, to whom we
listen with reverence and wonder, chose that mode of life for
themselves which they thought most likely to make them happy.”</p>

<p>“Very few,” said the poet, “live by choice. Every man is
placed in his present condition by causes which acted without
his foresight, and with which he did not always willingly co-operate;
and therefore you will rarely meet one who does
not think the lot of his neighbour better than his own.”</p>

<p>“I am pleased to think,” said the prince, “that my birth has
given me at least one advantage over others, by enabling me
to determine for myself. I have here the world before me; I will
review it at leisure: surely happiness is somewhere to be found.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE ASSOCIATES WITH YOUNG MEN OF SPIRIT AND GAIETY</span></h3>

<p>Rasselas rose next day, and resolved to begin his experiments
upon life. “Youth,” cried he, “is the time of gladness: I will
join myself to the young men whose only business is to gratify
their desires, and whose time is all spent in a succession of
enjoyments.”</p>

<p>To such societies he was readily admitted; but a few days
brought him back weary and disgusted. Their mirth was
without images; their laughter without motive; their pleasures
were gross and sensual, in which the mind had no part; their
conduct was at once wild and mean: they laughed at order and
at law; but the frown of power dejected, and the eye of wisdom
abashed them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
The prince soon concluded that he should never be happy in
a course of life of which he was ashamed. He thought it unsuitable
to a reasonable being to act without a plan, and to be
sad or cheerful only by chance. “Happiness,” said he, “must
be something solid and permanent, without fear and without
uncertainty.”</p>

<p>But his young companions had gained so much of his regard
by their frankness and courtesy, that he could not leave them
without warning and remonstrance. “My friends,” said he,
“I have seriously considered our manners and our prospects,
and find that we have mistaken our own interest. The first
years of man must make provision for the last. He that never
thinks never can be wise. Perpetual levity must end in ignorance;
and intemperance, though it may fire the spirits for an
hour, will make life short or miserable. Let us consider that
youth is of no long duration, and that in maturer age, when the
enchantments of fancy shall cease, and phantoms of delight
dance no more about us, we shall have no comforts but the
esteem of wise men, and the means of doing good. Let us,
therefore, stop, while to stop is in our power: let us live as men
who are some time to grow old, and to whom it will be the most
dreadful of all evils not to count their past years but by follies,
and to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only
by the maladies which riot has produced.”</p>

<p>They stared awhile in silence one upon another, and at last
drove him away by a general chorus of continued laughter.</p>

<p>The consciousness that his sentiments were just, and his
intentions kind, was scarcely sufficient to support him against
the horror of derision. But he recovered his tranquillity, and
pursued his search.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE FINDS A WISE AND HAPPY MAN</span></h3>

<p>As he was one day walking in the street, he saw a spacious
building, which all were, by the open doors, invited to enter.
He followed the stream of people, and found it a hall or school
of declamation, in which professors read lectures to their
auditory. He fixed his eye upon a sage raised above the rest,
who discoursed with great energy on the government of the
passions. His look was venerable, his action graceful, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pronunciation clear, and his diction elegant. He showed, with
great strength of sentiment and variety of illustration, that
human nature is degraded and debased when the lower faculties
predominate over the higher; that when fancy, the parent of
passion, usurps the dominion of the mind, nothing ensues but
the natural effect of unlawful government, perturbation and
confusion; that she betrays the fortresses of the intellect to
rebels, and excites her children to sedition against reason, their
lawful sovereign. He compared reason to the sun, of which the
light is constant, uniform, and lasting; and fancy to a meteor,
of bright but transitory lustre, irregular in its motion, and
delusive in its direction.</p>

<p>He then communicated the various precepts given from time
to time for the conquest of passion, and displayed the happiness
of those who had obtained the important victory, after which
man is no longer the slave of fear, nor the fool of hope; is no
more emaciated by envy, inflamed by anger, emasculated by
tenderness, or depressed by grief; but walks on calmly through
the tumults or privacies of life, as the sun pursues alike his
course through the calm or the stormy sky.</p>

<p>He enumerated many examples of heroes immovable by
pain or pleasure, who looked with indifference on those modes
or accidents to which the vulgar give the names of good and
evil. He exhorted his hearers to lay aside their prejudices,
and arm themselves against the shafts of malice or misfortune
by invulnerable patience; concluding, that this state only was
happiness, and that this happiness was in every one’s power.</p>

<p>Rasselas listened to him with the veneration due to the
instructions of a superior being, and waiting for him at the
door, humbly implored the liberty of visiting so great a master
of true wisdom. The lecturer hesitated a moment, when
Rasselas put a purse of gold into his hand, which he received
with a mixture of joy and wonder.</p>

<p>“I have found,” said the prince at his return to Imlac, “a
man who can teach all that is necessary to be known, who,
from the unshaken throne of rational fortitude, looks down
on the scenes of life changing beneath him. He speaks, and
attention watches his lips; he reasons, and conviction closes
his periods. This man shall be my future guide: I will learn
his doctrines, and imitate his life.”</p>

<p>“Be not too hasty,” said Imlac, “to trust or to admire the
teachers of morality: they discourse like angels, but they live
like men.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Rasselas, who could not conceive how any man could reason
so forcibly without feeling the cogency of his own arguments,
paid his visit in a few days, and was denied admission. He
had now learned the power of money, and made his way by a
piece of gold to the inner apartment, where he found the philosopher,
in a room half darkened, with his eyes misty, and his
face pale. “Sir,” said he, “you are come at a time when all
human friendship is useless: what I suffer cannot be remedied;
what I have lost cannot be supplied. My daughter, my only
daughter, from whose tenderness I expected all the comforts
of my age, died last night of a fever. My views, my purposes,
my hopes are at an end: I am now a lonely being disunited
from society.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the prince, “mortality is an event by which a
wise man can never be surprised: we know that death is always
near, and it should therefore always be expected.”</p>

<p>“Young man,” answered the philosopher, “you speak like
one that has never felt the pangs of separation.” “Have you
then forgot the precepts,” said Rasselas, “which you so powerfully
enforced? Has wisdom no strength to arm the heart
against calamity? Consider that external things are naturally
variable, but truth and reason are always the same.” “What
comfort,” said the mourner, “can truth and reason afford me?
Of what effect are they now, but to tell me that my daughter
will not be restored?”</p>

<p>The prince, whose humanity would not suffer him to insult
misery with reproof, went away convinced of the emptiness
of rhetorical sound, and the inefficacy of polished periods and
studied sentences.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br /><br />
<span class="sub">A GLIMPSE OF PASTORAL LIFE</span></h3>

<p>He was still eager upon the same inquiry; and having heard of
a hermit, that lived near the lowest cataract of the Nile, and
filled the whole country with the fame of his sanctity, resolved
to visit his retreat, and inquire whether that felicity which
public life could not afford was to be found in solitude; and
whether a man whose age and virtue made him venerable could
teach any peculiar art of shunning evils or enduring them.</p>

<p>Imlac and the princess agreed to accompany him; and, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the necessary preparations, they began their journey. Their
way lay through the fields, where shepherds tended their flocks,
and the lambs were playing upon the pasture. “This,” said
the poet, “is the life which has been often celebrated for its
innocence and quiet; let us pass the heat of the day among the
shepherds’ tents, and know whether all our searches are not
to terminate in pastoral simplicity.”</p>

<p>The proposal pleased him, and they induced the shepherds,
by small presents and familiar questions, to tell their opinion
of their own state. They were so rude and ignorant, so little
able to compare the good with the evil of the occupation, and
so indistinct in their narratives and descriptions, that very
little could be learned from them; but it was evident that
their hearts were cankered with discontent, that they considered
themselves as condemned to labour for the luxury of the rich,
and looked up with stupid malevolence toward those that
were placed above them.</p>

<p>The princess pronounced with vehemence, that she would
never suffer these envious savages to be her companions, and
that she should not soon be desirous of seeing any more specimens
of rustic happiness; but could not believe that all the
accounts of primeval pleasures were fabulous, and was yet in
doubt, whether life had anything that could be justly preferred
to the placid gratifications of fields and woods. She hoped
that the time would come, when, with a few virtuous and
elegant companions, she should gather flowers planted by her
own hand, fondle the lambs of her own ewe, and listen without
care, among brooks and breezes, to one of her maidens reading
in the shade.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE DANGER OF PROSPERITY</span></h3>

<p>On the next day they continued their journey, till the heat
compelled them to look round for shelter. At a small distance
they saw a thick wood, which they no sooner entered than they
perceived that they were approaching the habitations of men.
The shrubs were diligently cut away, to open walks where the
shades were darkest; the boughs of opposite trees were artificially
interwoven; seats of flowery turf were raised in vacant spaces;
and a rivulet, that wantoned along the side of a winding path,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had its banks sometimes opened into small basins, and its
stream sometimes obstructed by little mounds of stone, heaped
together to increase its murmurs.</p>

<p>They passed slowly through the wood, delighted with such
unexpected accommodations, and entertained each other with
conjecturing what or who he could be, that, in those rude and
unfrequented regions, had leisure and art for such harmless
luxury.</p>

<p>As they advanced, they heard the sound of music, and saw
youths and virgins dancing in the grove; and going still further,
beheld a stately palace built upon a hill, surrounded with woods.
The laws of eastern hospitality allowed them to enter, and the
master welcomed them like a man liberal and wealthy.</p>

<p>He was skilful enough in appearances soon to discern that
they were no common guests, and spread his table with magnificence.
The eloquence of Imlac caught his attention, and the
lofty courtesy of the princess excited his respect. When they
offered to depart, he entreated their stay, and was the next
day still more unwilling to dismiss them than before. They
were easily persuaded to stop, and civility grew up in time to
freedom and confidence.</p>

<p>The prince now saw all the domestics cheerful, and all the
face of nature smiling round the place, and could not forbear
to hope that he should find here what he was seeking; but when
he was congratulating the master upon his possessions, he
answered with a sigh, “My condition has indeed the appearance
of happiness, but appearances are delusive. My prosperity
puts my life in danger; the Bassa of Egypt is my enemy,
incensed only by my wealth and popularity. I have been
hitherto protected against him by the princes of the country;
but as the favour of the great is uncertain, I know not how
soon my defenders may be persuaded to share the plunder with
the Bassa. I have sent my treasures into a distant country,
and, upon the first alarm, am prepared to follow them. Then
will my enemies riot in my mansion, and enjoy the gardens
which I have planted.”</p>

<p>They all joined in lamenting his danger and deprecating his
exile; and the princess was so much disturbed with the tumult
of grief and indignation, that she retired to her apartment.</p>

<p>They continued with their kind inviter a few days longer,
and then went forward to find the hermit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE HAPPINESS OF SOLITUDE. THE HERMIT’S HISTORY</span></h3>

<p>They came on the third day, by the direction of the peasants,
to the hermit’s cell: it was a cavern in the side of a mountain,
overshadowed with palm trees; at such a distance from the
cataract, that nothing more was heard than a gentle uniform
murmur, such as composed the mind to pensive meditation,
especially when it was assisted by the wind whistling among the
branches. The first rude essay of nature had been so much
improved by human labour, that the cave contained several
apartments appropriated to different uses, and often afforded
lodging to travellers, whom darkness or tempests happened
to overtake.</p>

<p>The hermit sat on a bench at the door, to enjoy the coolness
of the evening. On one side lay a book with pens and papers,
on the other mechanical instruments of various kinds. As
they approached him unregarded, the princess observed that
he had not the countenance of a man that had found, or could
teach, the way to happiness.</p>

<p>They saluted him with great respect, which he repaid like a
man not unaccustomed to the forms of courts. “My children,”
said he, “if you have lost your way, you shall be willingly
supplied with such conveniences for the night as this cavern
will afford. I have all that nature requires, and you will not
expect delicacies in a hermit’s cell.”</p>

<p>They thanked him, and, entering, were pleased with the
neatness and regularity of the place. The hermit set flesh
and wine before them, though he fed only upon fruits and
water. His discourse was cheerful without levity, and pious
without enthusiasm. He soon gained the esteem of his guests,
and the princess repented of her hasty censure.</p>

<p>At last Imlac began thus: “I do not now wonder that your
reputation is so far extended. We have heard at Cairo of your
wisdom, and came hither to implore your direction for this
young man and maiden in the <i>choice of life</i>.”</p>

<p>“To him that lives well,” answered the hermit, “every form
of life is good; nor can I give any other rule for choice, than to
remove from all apparent evil.”</p>

<p>“He will remove most certainly from evil,” said the prince,
“who shall devote himself to that solitude which you have
recommended by your example.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
“I have indeed lived fifteen years in solitude,” said the hermit,
“but have no desire that my example should gain any imitators.
In my youth I professed arms, and was raised by degrees to the
highest military rank. I have traversed wide countries at the
head of my troops, and seen many battles and sieges. At last,
being disgusted by the preferments of a younger officer, and
feeling that my vigour was beginning to decay, I was resolved
to close my life in peace, having found the world full of snares,
discord, and misery. I had once escaped from the pursuit of
the enemy by the shelter of this cavern, and therefore chose it
for my final residence. I employed artificers to form it into
chambers, and stored it with all that I was likely to want.</p>

<p>“For some time after my retreat, I rejoiced like a tempest-beaten
sailor at his entrance into the harbour, being delighted
with the sudden change of the noise and hurry of war to stillness
and repose. When the pleasure of novelty went away,
I employed my hours in examining the plants which grow in
the valley, and the minerals which I collected from the rocks.
But that inquiry is now grown tasteless and irksome. I have
been for some time unsettled and distracted: my mind is disturbed
with a thousand perplexities of doubt and vanities of
imagination, which hourly prevail upon me, because I have no
opportunities of relaxation or diversion. I am sometimes
ashamed to think that I could not secure myself from vice, but
by retiring from the exercise of virtue, and begin to suspect
that I was rather impelled by resentment, than led by devotion,
into solitude. My fancy riots in scenes of folly, and I lament
that I have lost so much and have gained so little. In solitude,
if I escape the example of bad men, I want likewise the counsel
and conversation of the good. I have been long comparing
the evils with the advantages of society, and resolve to return
into the world to-morrow. The life of a solitary man will be
certainly miserable, but not certainly devout.”</p>

<p>They heard his resolution with surprise, but after a short
pause offered to conduct him to Cairo. He dug up a considerable
treasure which he had hid among the rocks, and accompanied
them to the city, on which, as he approached it, he gazed
with rapture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE HAPPINESS OF A LIFE LED ACCORDING TO NATURE</span></h3>

<p>Rasselas went often to an assembly of learned men, who met
at stated times to unbend their minds and compare their
opinions. Their manners were somewhat coarse, but their
conversation was instructive, and their disputations acute,
though sometimes too violent, and often continued till neither
controvertist remembered upon what question they began.
Some faults were almost general among them: every one was
desirous to dictate to the rest, and every one was pleased to
hear the genius or knowledge of another depreciated.</p>

<p>In this assembly Rasselas was relating his interview with
the hermit, and the wonder with which he heard him censure
a course of life which he had so deliberately chosen, and so
laudably followed. The sentiments of the hearers were various.
Some were of opinion that the folly of his choice had been
justly punished by condemnation to perpetual perseverance.
One of the youngest among them, with great vehemence, pronounced
him an hypocrite. Some talked of the right of society
to the labour of individuals, and considered retirement as a
desertion of duty. Others readily allowed that there was a
time when the claims of the public were satisfied, and when
a man might properly sequester himself, to review his life
and purify his heart.</p>

<p>One, who appeared more affected with the narrative than the
rest, thought it likely that the hermit would, in a few years, go
back to his retreat, and perhaps, if shame did not restrain or
death intercept him, return once more from his retreat into
the world: “For the hope of happiness,” said he, “is so strongly
impressed, that the longest experience is not able to efface it.
Of the present state, whatever it be, we feel, and are forced
to confess, the misery; yet, when the same state is again at a
distance, imagination paints it as desirable. But the time will
surely come, when desire will be no longer our torment, and
no man shall be wretched but by his own fault.”</p>

<p>“This,” said a philosopher, who had heard him with tokens
of great impatience, “is the present condition of a wise man.
The time is already come, when none are wretched but by their
own fault. Nothing is more idle than to inquire after happiness,
which nature has kindly placed within our reach. The way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to be happy is to live according to nature, in obedience to that
universal and unalterable law with which every heart is originally
impressed; which is not written on it by precept, but engraven
by destiny, not instilled by education, but infused at our
nativity. He that lives according to nature will suffer nothing
from the delusions of hope, or importunities of desire; he will
receive and reject with equability of temper, and act or suffer
as the reason of things shall alternately prescribe. Other men
may amuse themselves with subtle definitions, or intricate
ratiocinations. Let them learn to be wise by easier means:
let them observe the hind of the forest, and the linnet of the
grove; let them consider the life of animals, whose motions
are regulated by instinct: they obey their guide, and are happy.
Let us therefore, at length, cease to dispute, and learn to live;
throw away the encumbrance of precepts, which they who
utter them with so much pride and pomp do not understand,
and carry with us this simple and intelligible maxim: that
deviation from nature is deviation from happiness.”</p>

<p>When he had spoken, he looked round him with a placid air,
and enjoyed the consciousness of his own beneficence. “Sir,”
said the prince with great modesty, “as I, like all the rest of
mankind, am desirous of felicity, my closest attention has
been fixed upon your discourse; I doubt not the truth of a
position which a man so learned has so confidently advanced.
Let me only know what it is to live according to nature.”</p>

<p>“When I find young men so humble and so docile,” said the
philosopher, “I can deny them no information which my studies
have enabled me to afford. To live according to nature, is to
act always with due regard to the fitness arising from the
relations and qualities of causes and effects; to concur with
the great and unchangeable scheme of universal felicity; to
co-operate with the general disposition and tendency of the
present system of things.”</p>

<p>The prince soon found that this was one of the sages whom
he should understand less as he heard him longer. He therefore
bowed and was silent; and the philosopher, supposing him
satisfied, and the rest vanquished, rose up, and departed with
the air of a man that had co-operated with the present system.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE AND HIS SISTER DIVIDE BETWEEN THEM THE
WORK OF OBSERVATION</span></h3>

<p>Rasselas returned home full of reflections, doubtful how to
direct his future steps. Of the way to happiness he found
the learned and simple equally ignorant: but, as he was yet
young, he flattered himself that he had time remaining for
more experiments and further inquiries. He communicated to
Imlac his observations and his doubts, but was answered by
him with new doubts, and remarks that gave him no comfort.
He therefore discoursed more frequently and freely with his
sister, who had yet the same hope with himself, and always
assisted him to give some reason why, though he had been
hitherto frustrated, he might succeed at last.</p>

<p>“We have hitherto,” said she, “known but little of the world:
we have never yet been either great or mean. In our own
country, though we had royalty, we had no power; and in
this, we have not yet seen the private recesses of domestic
peace. Imlac favours not our search, lest we should in time
find him mistaken. We will divide the task between us: you
shall try what is to be found in the splendour of courts, and
I will range the shades of humbler life. Perhaps command
and authority may be the supreme blessings, as they afford
most opportunities of doing good; or, perhaps, what this world
can give may be found in the modest habitations of middle
fortune, too low for great designs, and too high for penury
and distress.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE EXAMINES THE HAPPINESS OF HIGH STATIONS</span></h3>

<p>Rasselas applauded the design, and appeared next day with a
splendid retinue at the court of the Bassa. He was soon distinguished
for his magnificence, and admitted, as a prince whose
curiosity had brought him from distant countries, to an intimacy
with the great officers, and frequent conversation with
the Bassa himself.</p>

<p>He was at first inclined to believe, that the man must be
pleased with his own condition whom all approached with
reverence and heard with obedience, and who had the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to extend his edicts to a whole kingdom. “There can be no
pleasure,” said he, “equal to that of feeling at once the joy
of thousands all made happy by wise administration. Yet
since by the law of subordination this sublime delight can
be in one nation but the lot of one, it is surely reasonable
to think that there is some satisfaction more popular and
accessible, and that millions can hardly be subjected to the
will of a single man, only to fill his particular breast with
incommunicable content.”</p>

<p>These thoughts were often in his mind, and he found no
solution of the difficulty. But as presents and civilities gained
him more familiarity, he found that almost every man who
stood high in employment hated all the rest, and was hated
by them, and that their lives were a continual succession of
plots and detections, stratagems and escapes, faction and
treachery. Many of those who surrounded the Bassa were
sent only to watch and report his conduct; every tongue was
muttering censure, and every eye was searching for a fault.</p>

<p>At last the letters of revocation arrived, the Bassa was carried
in chains to Constantinople, and his name was mentioned
no more.</p>

<p>“What are we now to think of the prerogatives of power?”
said Rasselas to his sister; “is it without any efficacy to good?
or, is the subordinate degree only dangerous, and the supreme
safe and glorious? Is the Sultan the only happy man in his
dominions? or, is the Sultan himself subject to the torments
of suspicion and the dread of enemies?”</p>

<p>In a short time the second Bassa was deposed; the Sultan
that had advanced him was murdered by the Janizaries, and
his successor had other views and different favourites.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE
THAN SUCCESS</span></h3>

<p>The princess, in the meantime, insinuated herself into many
families; for there are few doors through which liberality, joined
with good humour, cannot find its way. The daughters of
many houses were airy and cheerful; but Nekayah had been
too long accustomed to the conversation of Imlac and her
brother to be much pleased with childish levity, and prattle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which had no meaning. She found their thoughts narrow,
their wishes low, and their merriment often artificial. Their
pleasures, poor as they were, could not be preserved pure, but
were embittered by petty competitions and worthless emulation.
They were always jealous of the beauty of each other;
of a quality to which solicitude can add nothing, and from
which detraction can take nothing away. Many were in love
with triflers like themselves, and many fancied that they were
in love when in truth they were only idle. Their affection
was seldom fixed on sense or virtue, and therefore seldom ended
but in vexation. Their grief, however, like their joy, was
transient; everything floated in their mind unconnected with
the past or future, so that one desire easily gave way to another,
as a second stone cast into the water effaces and confounds the
circles of the first.</p>

<p>With these girls she played as with inoffensive animals,
and found them proud of her countenance, and weary of her
company.</p>

<p>But her purpose was to examine more deeply, and her
affability easily persuaded the hearts that were swelling with
sorrow to discharge their secrets in her ear; and those whom
hope flattered, or prosperity delighted, often courted her to
partake their pleasures.</p>

<p>The princess and her brother commonly met in the evening,
in a private summer-house on the bank of the Nile, and related
to each other the occurrences of the day. As they were sitting
together, the princess cast her eyes upon the river that flowed
before her. “Answer,” said she, “great father of waters, thou
that rollest thy floods through eighty nations, to the invocations
of the daughter of the native king. Tell me if thou waterest,
through all thy course, a single habitation from which thou
dost not hear the murmurs of complaint?”</p>

<p>“You are, then,” said Rasselas, “not more successful in
private houses than I have been in courts.” “I have, since
the last partition of our provinces,” said the princess, “enabled
myself to enter familiarly into many families, where there was
the fairest show of prosperity and peace, and know not one house
that is not haunted by some fury that destroys their quiet.</p>

<p>“I did not seek ease among the poor, because I concluded
that there it could not be found. But I saw many poor, whom
I had supposed to live in affluence. Poverty has, in large cities,
very different appearances: it is often concealed in splendour,
and often in extravagance. It is the care of a very great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
part of mankind to conceal their indigence from the rest; they
support themselves by temporary expedients, and every day is
lost in contriving for the morrow.</p>

<p>“This, however, was an evil, which, though frequent, I saw
with less pain, because I could relieve it. Yet some have
refused my bounties; more offended with my quickness to
detect their wants, than pleased with my readiness to succour
them; and others, whose exigencies compelled them to admit my
kindness, have never been able to forgive their benefactress.
Many, however, have been sincerely grateful, without the
ostentation of gratitude, or the hope of other favours.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE</span></h3>

<p>Nekayah, perceiving her brother’s attention fixed, proceeded
in her narrative.</p>

<p>“In families, where there is or is not poverty, there is commonly
discord: if a kingdom be, as Imlac tells us, a great
family, a family likewise is a little kingdom, torn with factions
and exposed to revolutions. An unpractised observer expects
the love of parents and children to be constant and equal; but
this kindness seldom continues beyond the years of infancy:
in a short time the children become rivals to their parents;
benefits are allayed by reproaches, and gratitude debased
by envy.</p>

<p>“Parents and children seldom act in concert: each child
endeavours to appropriate the esteem or fondness of the parents,
and the parents, with yet less temptation, betray each other
to their children; thus, some place their confidence in the
father, and some in the mother, and by degrees the house is
filled with artifices and feuds.</p>

<p>“The opinions of children and parents, of the young and the
old, are naturally opposite, by the contrary effects of hope and
despondence, of expectation and experience, without crime or
folly on either side. The colours of life in youth and age appear
different, as the face of nature in spring and winter. And
how can children credit the assertions of parents, which their
own eyes show them to be false?</p>

<p>“Few parents act in such a manner as much to enforce their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
maxims by the credit of their lives. The old man trusts wholly
to slow contrivance and gradual progression; the youth expects
to force his way by genius, vigour, and precipitance. The old
man pays regard to riches, and the youth reverences virtue.
The old man deifies prudence; the youth commits himself to
magnanimity and chance. The young man, who intends no ill,
believes that none is intended, and therefore acts with openness
and candour; but his father, having suffered the injuries of
fraud, is impelled to suspect, and too often allured to practise
it. Age looks with anger on the temerity of youth, and youth
with contempt on the scrupulosity of age. Thus parents and
children, for the greatest part, live on to love less and less; and,
if those whom nature has thus closely united are the torments of
each other, where shall we look for tenderness and consolation?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the prince, “you must have been unfortunate
in your choice of acquaintance: I am unwilling to believe, that
the most tender of all relations is thus impeded in its effects
by natural necessity.”</p>

<p>“Domestic discord,” answered she, “is not inevitably and
fatally necessary; but yet it is not easily avoided. We seldom
see that a whole family is virtuous; the good and evil cannot
well agree; and the evil can yet less agree with one another;
even the virtuous fall sometimes to variance, when their virtues
are of different kinds, and tending to extremes. In general,
those parents have most reverence who most deserve it; for he
that lives well cannot be despised.</p>

<p>“Many other evils infest private life. Some are the slaves
of servants whom they have trusted with their affairs. Some
are kept in continual anxiety by the caprice of rich relations,
whom they cannot please and dare not offend. Some husbands
are imperious, and some wives perverse: and, as it is always
more easy to do evil than good, though the wisdom or virtue
of one can very rarely make many happy, the folly or vice of
one may often make many miserable.”</p>

<p>“If such be the general effect of marriage,” said the prince,
“I shall, for the future, think it dangerous to connect my
interest with that of another, lest I should be unhappy by my
partner’s fault.”</p>

<p>“I have met,” said the princess, “with many who live single
for that reason; but I never found that their prudence ought
to raise envy. They dream away their time without friendship,
without fondness, and are driven to rid themselves of the
day, for which they have no use, by childish amusements or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
vicious delights. They act as beings under the constant sense
of some known inferiority, that fills their minds with rancour,
and their tongues with censure. They are peevish at home,
and malevolent abroad; and, as the outlaws of human nature,
make it their business and their pleasure to disturb that society
which debars them from its privileges. To live without feeling
or exciting sympathy, to be fortunate without adding to the
felicity of others, or afflicted without tasting the balm of pity,
is a state more gloomy than solitude: it is not retreat, but
exclusion from mankind. Marriage has many pains, but
celibacy has no pleasures.”</p>

<p>“What then is to be done?” said Rasselas; “the more we
inquire, the less we can resolve. Surely he is most likely to
please himself that has no other inclination or regard.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS</span></h3>

<p>The conversation had a short pause. The prince, having
considered his sister’s observations, told her, that she had
surveyed life with prejudice, and supposed misery where she
did not find it. “Your narrative,” says he, “throws yet a
darker gloom upon the prospects of futurity; the predictions of
Imlac were but faint sketches of the evils painted by Nekayah.
I have been lately convinced that quiet is not the daughter of
grandeur or of power: that her presence is not to be bought
by wealth, nor enforced by conquest. It is evident, that as
any man acts in a wider compass, he must be more exposed
to opposition from enmity, or miscarriage from chance; whoever
has many to please or to govern, must use the ministry of
many agents, some of whom will be wicked, and some ignorant;
by some he will be misled, and by others betrayed. If he
gratifies one he will offend another; those that are not favoured
will think themselves injured; and, since favours can be conferred
but upon few, the greater number will be always discontented.”</p>

<p>“The discontent,” said the princess, “which is thus unreasonable,
I hope that I shall always have spirit to despise,
and you power to repress.”</p>

<p>“Discontent,” answered Rasselas, “will not always be without
reason, under the most just and vigilant administration of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
public affairs. None, however attentive, can always discover
that merit which indigence or faction may happen to obscure;
and none, however powerful, can always reward it. Yet he
that sees inferior desert advanced above him will naturally
impute that preference to partiality or caprice; and, indeed, it
can scarcely be hoped that any man, however magnanimous
by nature, or exalted by condition, will be able to persist for
ever in the fixed and inexorable justice of distribution: he will
sometimes indulge his own affections, and sometimes those of
his favourites; he will permit some to please him who can
never serve him; he will discover in those whom he loves,
qualities which in reality they do not possess; and to those
from whom he receives pleasure, he will in his turn endeavour
to give it. Thus will recommendations sometimes prevail
which were purchased by money, or by the more destructive
bribery of flattery and servility.</p>

<p>“He that has much to do will do something wrong, and of
that wrong must suffer the consequences; and, if it were possible
that he should always act rightly, yet when such numbers are
to judge of his conduct, the bad will censure and obstruct him
by malevolence, and the good sometimes by mistake.</p>

<p>“The highest stations cannot therefore hope to be the abodes
of happiness, which I would willingly believe to have fled from
thrones and palaces to seats of humble privacy and placid
obscurity. For what can hinder the satisfaction, or intercept
the expectations, of him whose abilities are adequate to his
employments, who sees with his own eyes the whole circuit of
his influence, who chooses by his own knowledge all whom he
trusts, and whom none are tempted to deceive by hope or
fear? Surely he has nothing to do but to love and to be loved,
to be virtuous and to be happy.”</p>

<p>“Whether perfect happiness would be procured by perfect
goodness,” said Nekayah, “this world will never afford an
opportunity of deciding. But this, at least, may be maintained,
that we do not always find visible happiness in proportion to
visible virtue. All natural and almost all political evils are
incident alike to the bad and good: they are confounded in
the misery of a famine, and not much distinguished in the
fury of a faction; they sink together in a tempest, and are
driven together from their country by invaders. All that
virtue can afford is quietness of conscience and a steady prospect
of a happier state; this may enable us to endure calamity with
patience; but remember that patience must suppose pain.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">RASSELAS AND NEKAYAH CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION</span></h3>

<p>“Dear princess,” said Rasselas, “you fall into the common
errors of exaggeratory declamation, by producing, in a familiar
disquisition, examples of national calamities, and scenes of
extensive misery, which are found in books rather than in the
world, and which, as they are horrid, are ordained to be rare.
Let us not imagine evils which we do not feel, nor injure life by
misrepresentations. I cannot bear that querulous eloquence
which threatens every city with a siege like that of Jerusalem,
that makes famine attend on every flight of locusts, and suspends
pestilence on the wing of every blast that issues from
the south.</p>

<p>“On necessary and inevitable evils which overwhelm kingdoms
at once, all disputation is vain: when they happen they
must be endured. But it is evident, that these bursts of
universal distress are more dreaded than felt; thousands and
ten thousands flourish in youth and wither in age, without the
knowledge of any other than domestic evils, and share the
same pleasures and vexations, whether their kings are mild or
cruel, whether the armies of their country pursue their enemies
or retreat before them. While courts are disturbed with
intestine competitions, and ambassadors are negotiating in
foreign countries, the smith still plies his anvil, and the husbandman
drives his plough forward; the necessaries of life are
required and obtained; and the successive business of the seasons
continues to make its wonted revolutions.</p>

<p>“Let us cease to consider what, perhaps, may never happen,
and what, when it shall happen, will laugh at human speculation.
We will not endeavour to modify the motions of the elements,
or to fix the destiny of kingdoms. It is our business to consider
what beings like us may perform; each labouring for his own
happiness, by promoting within his circle, however narrow,
the happiness of others.</p>

<p>“Marriage is evidently the dictate of nature; men and
women are made to be companions of each other; and therefore
I cannot be persuaded but that marriage is one of the
means of happiness.”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said the princess, “whether marriage be more
than one of the innumerable modes of human misery. When
I see and reckon the various forms of connubial infelicity, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
unexpected causes of lasting discord, the diversities of temper,
the oppositions of opinion, the rude collisions of contrary desire
where both are urged by violent impulses, the obstinate contests
of disagreeing virtues where both are supported by consciousness
of good intention, I am sometimes disposed to think with
the severer casuists of most nations, that marriage is rather
permitted than approved, and that none, but by the instigation
of a passion too much indulged, entangle themselves with
indissoluble compacts.”</p>

<p>“You seem to forget,” replied Rasselas, “that you have,
even now, represented celibacy as less happy than marriage.
Both conditions may be bad, but they cannot both be worst.
Thus it happens when wrong opinions are entertained, that they
mutually destroy each other, and leave the mind open to truth.”</p>

<p>“I did not expect,” answered the princess, “to hear that
imputed to falsehood which is the consequence only of frailty.
To the mind, as to the eye, it is difficult to compare with exactness
objects vast in their extent, and various in their parts.
Where we see or conceive the whole at once, we readily note
the discriminations, and decide the preference; but of two
systems, of which neither can be surveyed by any human being
in its full compass of magnitude and multiplicity of complication,
where is the wonder that, judging of the whole by parts,
I am alternately affected by one and the other, as either presses
on my memory or fancy? We differ from ourselves, just as we
differ from each other, when we see only part of the question,
as in the multifarious relations of politics and morality; but
when we perceive the whole at once, as in numerical computations,
all agree in one judgment, and none ever varies his
opinion.”</p>

<p>“Let us not add,” said the prince, “to the other evils of life
the bitterness of controversy, nor endeavour to vie with each
other in subtleties of argument. We are employed in a search,
of which both are equally to enjoy the success, or suffer by the
miscarriage. It is therefore fit that we assist each other. You
surely conclude too hastily from the infelicity of marriage
against its institution: will not the misery of life prove equally
that life cannot be the gift of heaven? The world must be
peopled by marriage, or peopled without it.”</p>

<p>“How the world is to be peopled,” returned Nekayah, “is not
my care, and needs not be yours. I see no danger that the
present generation should omit to leave successors behind them:
we are not now inquiring for the world, but for ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE DEBATE OF MARRIAGE CONTINUED</span></h3>

<p>“The good of the whole,” said Rasselas, “is the same with
the good of all its parts. If marriage be best for mankind, it
must be evidently best for individuals; or a permanent and
necessary duty must be the cause of evil, and some must be
inevitably sacrificed to the convenience of others. In the
estimate which you have made of the two states, it appears
that the incommodities of a single life are, in a great measure,
necessary and certain, but those of the conjugal state accidental
and avoidable.</p>

<p>“I cannot forbear to flatter myself, that prudence and benevolence
will make marriage happy. The general folly of mankind
is the cause of general complaint. What can be expected but
disappointment and repentance from a choice made in the
immaturity of youth, in the ardour of desire, without judgment,
without foresight, without inquiry after conformity of
opinions, similarity of manners, rectitude of judgment, or
purity of sentiment?</p>

<p>“Such is the common process of marriage. A youth and
maiden, meeting by chance or brought together by artifice,
exchange glances, reciprocate civilities, go home, and dream
of one another. Having little to divert attention, or diversify
thought, they find themselves uneasy when they are apart,
and therefore conclude that they shall be happy together.
They marry, and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness
before had concealed: they wear out life in altercations,
and charge nature with cruelty.</p>

<p>“From those early marriages proceeds likewise the rivalry
of parents and children. The son is eager to enjoy the world
before the father is willing to forsake it, and there is hardly
room at once for two generations. The daughter begins to
bloom before the mother can be content to fade, and neither
can forbear to wish for the absence of the other.</p>

<p>“Surely all these evils may be avoided by that deliberation
and delay which prudence prescribes to irrevocable choice.
In the variety and jollity of youthful pleasures, life may be
well enough supported without the help of a partner. Longer
time will increase experience, and wider views will allow better
opportunities of inquiry and selection: one advantage, at least,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
will be certain; the parents will be visibly older than their
children.”</p>

<p>“What reason cannot collect,” said Nekayah, “and what
experiment has not yet taught, can be known only from the
report of others. I have been told that late marriages are
not eminently happy. This is a question too important to
be neglected, and I have often proposed it to those whose
accuracy of remark, and comprehensiveness of knowledge, made
their suffrages worthy of regard. They have generally determined
that it is dangerous for a man and woman to suspend
their fate upon each other, at a time when opinions are fixed,
and habits are established; when friendships have been contracted
on both sides; when life has been planned into method,
and the mind has long enjoyed the contemplation of its own
prospects.</p>

<p>“It is scarcely possible that two, travelling through the world
under the conduct of chance, should have been both directed
to the same path, and it will not often happen that either will
quit the track which custom has made pleasing. When the
desultory levity of youth has settled into regularity, it is soon
succeeded by pride ashamed to yield, or obstinacy delighting
to contend. And even though mutual esteem produces mutual
desire to please, time itself, as it modifies unchangeably the
external mien, determines likewise the direction of the passions,
and gives an inflexible rigidity to the manners. Long customs
are not easily broken: he that attempts to change the course of
his own life very often labours in vain: and how shall we do that
for others, which we are seldom able to do for ourselves?”</p>

<p>“But surely,” interposed the prince, “you suppose the chief
motive of choice forgotten or neglected. Whenever I shall seek
a wife, it shall be my first question, whether she be willing to
be led by reason.”</p>

<p>“Thus it is,” said Nekayah, “that philosophers are deceived.
There are a thousand familiar disputes which reason never can
decide; questions that elude investigation, and make logic
ridiculous; cases where something must be done, and where
little can be said. Consider the state of mankind, and inquire
how few can be supposed to act upon any occasions, whether
small or great, with all the reasons of action present to their
minds. Wretched would be the pair above all names of
wretchedness, who should be doomed to adjust by reason,
every morning, all the minute detail of a domestic day.</p>

<p>“Those who marry at an advanced age will probably escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the encroachments of their children; but, in diminution of this
advantage, they will be likely to leave them, ignorant and
helpless, to a guardian’s mercy; or, if that should not happen,
they must at least go out of the world before they see those
whom they love best either wise or great.</p>

<p>“From their children, if they have less to fear, they have
less also to hope, and they lose, without equivalent, the joys
of early love, and the convenience of uniting with manners
pliant, and minds susceptible of new impressions, which might
wear away their dissimilitudes by long cohabitation, as soft
bodies, by continual attrition, conform their surfaces to each
other.</p>

<p>“I believe it will be found that those who marry late are
best pleased with their children, and those who marry early,
with their partners.”</p>

<p>“The union of these two affections,” said Rasselas, “would
produce all that could be wished. Perhaps there is a time
when marriage might unite them, a time neither too early for
the father, nor too late for the husband.”</p>

<p>“Every hour,” answered the princess, “confirms my prejudice
in favour of the position so often uttered by the mouth of Imlac,
‘That nature sets her gifts on the right hand and on the left.’
Those conditions which flatter hope and attract desire are so
constituted that, as we approach one, we recede from another.
There are goods so opposed that we cannot seize both, but, by
too much prudence, may pass between them at too great a
distance to reach either. This is often the fate of long consideration:
he does nothing who endeavours to do more than is
allowed to humanity. Flatter not yourself with contrarieties
of pleasure. Of the blessings set before you, make your choice,
and be content. No man can taste the fruits of autumn while
he is delighting his scent with the flowers of the spring: no man
can, at the same time, fill his cup from the source and from
the mouth of the Nile.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX<br /><br />
<span class="sub">IMLAC ENTERS AND CHANGES THE CONVERSATION</span></h3>

<p>Here Imlac entered, and interrupted them. “Imlac,” said
Rasselas, “I have been taking from the princess the dismal
history of private life, and am almost discouraged from further
search.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Imlac, “that while you are making
the choice of life, you neglect to live. You wander about a
single city, which, however large and diversified, can now afford
few novelties, and forget that you are in a country, famous
among the earliest monarchies for the power and wisdom of
its inhabitants; a country where the sciences first dawned that
illuminate the world, and beyond which the arts cannot be
traced of civil society or domestic life.</p>

<p>“The old Egyptians have left behind them monuments of
industry and power, before which all European magnificence is
confessed to fade away. The ruins of their architecture are
the schools of modern builders, and from the wonders which
time has spared, we may conjecture, though uncertainly, what
it has destroyed.”</p>

<p>“My curiosity,” said Rasselas, “does not very strongly lead
me to survey piles of stone, or mounds of earth; my business is
with man. I came hither not to measure fragments of temples,
or trace choked aqueducts, but to look upon the various scenes
of the present world.”</p>

<p>“The things that are now before us,” said the princess,
“require attention, and deserve it. What have I to do with
the heroes or the monuments of ancient times? with times
which never can return, and heroes whose form of life was
different from all that the present condition of mankind requires
or allows?”</p>

<p>“To know anything,” returned the poet, “we must know
its effects; to see men we must see their works, that we may
learn what reason has dictated, or passion has incited, and
find what are the most powerful motives of action. To judge
rightly on the present, we must oppose it to the past; for all
judgment is comparative, and of the future nothing can be
known. The truth is, that no mind is much employed upon
the present; recollection and anticipation fill up almost all
our moments. Our passions are joy and grief, love and hatred,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hope and fear. Of joy and grief the past is the object, and
the future of hope and fear: even love and hatred respect the
past, for the cause must have been before the effect.</p>

<p>“The present state of things is the consequence of the former,
and it is natural to inquire what were the sources of the good
that we enjoy, or the evil that we suffer. If we act only for
ourselves, to neglect the study of history is not prudent;
if we are entrusted with the care of others, it is not just.
Ignorance, when it is voluntary, is criminal; and he may
properly be charged with evil, who refused to learn how he
might prevent it.</p>

<p>“There is no part of history so generally useful as that which
relates the progress of the human mind, the gradual improvement
of reason, the successive advances of science, the vicissitudes of
learning and ignorance, which are the light and darkness of
thinking beings, the extinction and resuscitation of arts, and
the revolutions of the intellectual world. If accounts of battles
and invasions are peculiarly the business of princes, the useful
or elegant arts are not to be neglected; those who have kingdoms
to govern have understandings to cultivate.</p>

<p>“Example is always more efficacious than precept. A soldier
is formed in war, and a painter must copy pictures. In this,
contemplative life has the advantage: great actions are seldom
seen, but the labours of art are always at hand for those who
desire to know what art has been able to perform.</p>

<p>“When the eye or the imagination is struck with any uncommon
work, the next transition of an active mind is to
the means by which it was performed. Here begins the true
use of such contemplation; we enlarge our comprehension by
new ideas, and perhaps recover some art lost to mankind, or
learn what is less perfectly known in our own country. At
least we compare our own with former times, and either rejoice
at our improvements, or, what is the first motion towards
good, discover our defects.”</p>

<p>“I am willing,” said the prince, “to see all that can deserve
my search.” “And I,” said the princess, “shall rejoice to
learn something of the manners of antiquity.”</p>

<p>“The most pompous monument of Egyptian greatness, and
one of the most bulky works of manual industry,” said Imlac,
“are the Pyramids; fabrics raised before the time of history,
and of which the earliest narratives afford us only uncertain
traditions. Of these the greatest is still standing, very little
injured by time.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“Let us visit them to-morrow,” said Nekayah. “I have
often heard of the Pyramids, and shall not rest till I have seen
them within and without with my own eyes.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THEY VISIT THE PYRAMIDS</span></h3>

<p>The resolution being thus taken, they set out the next day.
They laid tents upon their camels, being resolved to stay among
the Pyramids till their curiosity was fully satisfied. They
travelled gently, turned aside to everything remarkable, stopped
from time to time and conversed with the inhabitants, and
observed the various appearances of towns ruined and inhabited,
of wild and cultivated nature.</p>

<p>When they came to the Great Pyramid, they were astonished
at the extent of the base and the height of the top. Imlac
explained to them the principles upon which the pyramidal
form was chosen for a fabrick intended to co-extend its duration
with that of the world: he showed that its gradual diminution
gave it such stability as defeated all the common attacks of the
elements, and could scarcely be overthrown by earthquakes
themselves, the least resistible of natural violence. A concussion
that should shatter the Pyramid would threaten the dissolution
of the continent.</p>

<p>They measured all its dimensions, and pitched their tents at
its foot. Next day they prepared to enter its exterior apartments,
and having hired the common guides, climbed up to
the first passage, when the favourite of the princess, looking
into the cavity, stepped back and trembled. “Pekuah,” said
the princess, “of what art thou afraid?” “Of the narrow
entrance,” answered the lady, “and of the dreadful gloom.
I dare not enter a place which must surely be inhabited by
unquiet souls. The original possessors of these dreadful vaults
will start up before us, and perhaps shut us in for ever.” She
spoke, and threw her arms round the neck of her mistress.</p>

<p>“If all your fear be of apparitions,” said the prince, “I will
promise you safety: there is no danger from the dead: he that is
once buried will be seen no more.”</p>

<p>“That the dead are seen no more,” said Imlac, “I will not
undertake to maintain, against the concurrent and unvaried
testimony of all ages, and of all nations. There is no people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rude or learned, among whom apparitions of the dead are not
related and believed. This opinion, which perhaps prevails
as far as human nature is diffused, could become universal only
by its truth: those that never heard of one another would not
have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience can make
credible. That it is doubted by single cavillers, can very little
weaken the general evidence; and some who deny it with their
tongues confess it by their fears.</p>

<p>“Yet I do not mean to add new terrors to those which have
already seized upon Pekuah. There can be no reason why
spectres should haunt the Pyramid more than other places, or
why they should have power or will to hurt innocence and
purity. Our entrance is no violation of their privileges; we can
take nothing from them, how then can we offend them?”</p>

<p>“My dear Pekuah,” said the princess, “I will always go before
you, and Imlac shall follow you. Remember that you are the
companion of the Princess of Abyssinia.”</p>

<p>“If the princess is pleased that her servant should die,”
returned the lady, “let her command some death less dreadful
than enclosure in this horrid cavern. You know I dare not
disobey you: I must go if you command me; but, if I once enter,
I never shall come back.”</p>

<p>The princess saw that her fear was too strong for expostulation
or reproof, and embracing her, told her that she should
stay in the tent till their return. Pekuah was yet not satisfied,
but entreated the princess not to pursue so dreadful a purpose
as that of entering the recesses of the Pyramid. “Though I
cannot teach courage,” said Nekayah, “I must not learn
cowardice; nor leave at last undone what I came hither only
to do.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THEY ENTER THE PYRAMID</span></h3>

<p>Pekuah descended to the tents, and the rest entered the
Pyramid: they passed through the galleries, surveyed the vaults
of marble, and examined the chest in which the body of the
founder is supposed to have been reposited. They then sat
down in one of the most spacious chambers to rest awhile before
they attempted to return.</p>

<p>“We have now,” said Imlac, “gratified our minds with an
exact view of the greatest work of man, except the wall of China.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
“Of the wall it is very easy to assign the motive. It secured
a wealthy and timorous nation from the incursions of barbarians,
whose unskilfulness in arts made it easier for them to
supply their wants by rapine than by industry, and who from
time to time poured in upon the habitations of peaceful commerce,
as vultures descend upon domestic fowl. Their celerity
and fierceness made the wall necessary, and their ignorance made
it efficacious.</p>

<p>“But for the Pyramids no reason has ever been given adequate
to the cost and labour of the work. The narrowness of the
chambers proves that it could afford no retreat from enemies,
and treasures might have been reposited at far less expense with
equal security. It seems to have been erected only in compliance
with that hunger of imagination which preys incessantly
upon life, and must be always appeased by some employment.
Those who have already all that they can enjoy must enlarge
their desires. He that has built for use, till use is supplied, must
begin to build for vanity, and extend his plan to the utmost
power of human performance, that he may not be soon reduced
to form another wish.</p>

<p>“I consider this mighty structure as a monument of the
insufficiency of human enjoyments. A king whose power is
unlimited, and whose treasures surmount all real and imaginary
wants, is compelled to solace, by the erection of a Pyramid,
the satiety of dominion and tastelessness of pleasures, and to
amuse the tediousness of declining life, by seeing thousands
labouring without end, and one stone, for no purpose, laid upon
another. Whoever thou art that, not content with a moderate
condition, imaginest happiness in royal magnificence, and dreamest
that command or riches can feed the appetite of novelty
with perpetual gratifications, survey the Pyramids, and confess
thy folly!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCESS MEETS WITH AN UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNE</span></h3>

<p>They rose up, and returned through the cavity at which they
had entered, and the princess prepared for her favourite a long
narrative of dark labyrinths and costly rooms, and of the
different impressions which the varieties of the way had made
upon her. But when they came to their train, they found every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
one silent and dejected; the men discovered shame and fear in
their countenances, and the women were weeping in the tents.</p>

<p>What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but
immediately inquired. “You had scarcely entered into the
Pyramid,” said one of the attendants, “when a troop of Arabs
rushed upon us; we were too few to resist them, and too slow
to escape. They were about to search the tents, set us on our
camels, and drive us along before them, when the approach of
some Turkish horsemen put them to flight; but they seized the
Lady Pekuah with her two maids, and carried them away.
The Turks are now pursuing them by our instigation, but I fear
they will not be able to overtake them.”</p>

<p>The princess was overpowered with surprise and grief. Rasselas,
in the first heat of his resentment, ordered his servants
to follow him, and prepared to pursue the robbers with his sabre
in his hand. “Sir,” said Imlac, “what can you hope from
violence or valour? the Arabs are mounted on horses trained to
battle and retreat; we have only beasts of burden. By leaving
our present station we may lose the princess, but cannot hope
to regain Pekuah.”</p>

<p>In a short time the Turks returned, having not been able to
reach the enemy. The princess burst out into new lamentations,
and Rasselas could scarcely forbear to reproach them with
cowardice; but Imlac was of opinion that the escape of the
Arabs was no addition to their misfortune, for perhaps they
would have killed their captives rather than have resigned them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THEY RETURN TO CAIRO WITHOUT PEKUAH</span></h3>

<p>There was nothing to be hoped from longer stay. They
returned to Cairo, repenting of their curiosity, censuring the
negligence of the government, lamenting their own rashness
which had neglected to procure a guard, imagining many
expedients by which the loss of Pekuah might have been prevented,
and resolving to do something for her recovery, though
none could find anything proper to be done.</p>

<p>Nekayah retired to her chamber, where her women attempted
to comfort her by telling her that all had their troubles, and
that Lady Pekuah had enjoyed much happiness in the world for
a long time, and might reasonably expect a change of fortune.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
They hoped that some good would befall her wheresoever she
was, and that their mistress would find another friend who
might supply her place.</p>

<p>The princess made them no answer, and they continued the
form of condolence, not much grieved in their hearts that the
favourite was lost.</p>

<p>Next day the prince presented to the Bassa a memorial of
the wrong which he had suffered, and a petition for redress.
The Bassa threatened to punish the robbers, but did not attempt
to catch them; nor indeed could any account or description be
given by which he might direct the pursuit.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that nothing would be done by authority.
Governors, being accustomed to hear of more crimes than
they can punish, and more wrongs than they can redress, set
themselves at ease by indiscriminate negligence, and presently
forget the request when they lose sight of the petitioner.</p>

<p>Imlac then endeavoured to gain some intelligence by private
agents. He found many who pretended to an exact knowledge
of all the haunts of the Arabs, and to regular correspondence
with their chiefs, and who readily undertook the recovery of
Pekuah. Of these, some were furnished with money for their
journey, and came back no more; some were liberally paid for
accounts which a few days discovered to be false. But the
princess would not suffer any means, however improbable, to
be left untried. While she was doing something, she kept her
hope alive. As one expedient failed, another was suggested;
when one messenger returned unsuccessful, another was
dispatched to a different quarter.</p>

<p>Two months had now passed, and of Pekuah nothing had
been heard; the hopes which they had endeavoured to raise in
each other grew more languid, and the princess, when she saw
nothing more to be tried, sunk down inconsolable in hopeless
dejection. A thousand times she reproached herself with the
easy compliance by which she permitted her favourite to stay
behind her. “Had not my fondness,” said she, “lessened my
authority, Pekuah had not dared to talk of her terrors. She
ought to have feared me more than spectres. A severe look
would have overpowered her; a peremptory command would
have compelled obedience. Why did foolish indulgence prevail
upon me? Why did I not speak, and refuse to hear?”</p>

<p>“Great princess,” said Imlac, “do not reproach yourself
for your virtue, or consider that as blameable by which evil has
accidentally been caused. Your tenderness for the timidity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of Pekuah was generous and kind. When we act according
to our duty, we commit the event to Him by whose laws our
actions are governed, and who will suffer none to be finally
punished for obedience. When, in prospect of some good,
whether natural or moral, we break the rules prescribed us,
we withdraw from the direction of superior wisdom, and take
all consequences upon ourselves. Man cannot so far know the
connexion of causes and events, as that he may venture to do
wrong in order to do right. When we pursue our end by lawful
means, we may always console our miscarriage by the hope of
future recompense. When we consult only our own policy, and
attempt to find a nearer way to good, by overleaping the settled
boundaries of right and wrong, we cannot be happy even by
success, because we cannot escape the consciousness of our
fault: but if we miscarry, the disappointment is irremediably
embittered. How comfortless is the sorrow of him who feels
at once the pangs of guilt, and the vexation of calamity which
guilt has brought upon him!</p>

<p>“Consider, princess, what would have been your condition,
if the Lady Pekuah had entreated to accompany you, and being
compelled to stay in the tents, had been carried away; or how
would you have borne the thought, if you had forced her into
the Pyramid, and she had died before you in agonies of
terror.”</p>

<p>“Had either happened,” said Nekayah, “I could not have
endured life till now: I should have been tortured to madness
by the remembrance of such cruelty, or must have pined away
in abhorrence of myself.”</p>

<p>“This at least,” said Imlac, “is the present reward of virtuous
conduct, that no unlucky consequence can oblige us to repent it.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH</span></h3>

<p>Nekayah, being thus reconciled to herself, found that no evil
is insupportable, but that which is accompanied with consciousness
of wrong. She was from that time delivered from the
violence of tempestuous sorrow, and sunk into silent pensiveness
and gloomy tranquillity. She sat from morning to evening
recollecting all that had been done or said by her Pekuah,
treasured up with care every trifle on which Pekuah had set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
an accidental value, and which might recall to mind any little
incident or careless conversation. The sentiments of her whom
she now expected to see no more, were treasured in her memory
as rules of life, and she deliberated to no other end than to
conjecture, on any occasion, what would have been the opinion
and counsel of Pekuah.</p>

<p>The women by whom she was attended knew nothing of her
real condition, and therefore she could not talk to them but
with caution and reserve. She began to remit her curiosity,
having no great care to collect notions which she had no convenience
of uttering. Rasselas endeavoured first to comfort,
and afterwards to divert her; he hired musicians, to whom she
seemed to listen, but did not hear them, and procured masters
to instruct her in various arts, whose lectures, when they
visited her again, were again to be repeated. She had lost her
taste of pleasure, and her ambition of excellence. And her
mind, though forced into short excursions, always recurred to
the image of her friend.</p>

<p>Imlac was every morning earnestly enjoined to renew his
inquiries, and was asked every night whether he had yet heard
of Pekuah, till not being able to return the princess the answer
that she desired, he was less and less willing to come into her
presence. She observed his backwardness, and commanded him
to attend her. “You are not,” said she, “to confound impatience
with resentment, or to suppose that I charge you with
negligence, because I repine at your unsuccessfulness. I do
not much wonder at your absence; I know that the unhappy
are never pleasing, and that all naturally avoid the contagion of
misery. To hear complaints is wearisome alike to the wretched
and the happy; for who would cloud, by adventitious grief,
the short gleams of gaiety which life allows us? or who, that is
struggling under his own evils, will add to them the miseries
of another?</p>

<p>“The time is at hand, when none shall be disturbed any
longer by the sighs of Nekayah; my search after happiness is
now at an end. I am resolved to retire from the world with all
its flatteries and deceits, and will hide myself in solitude, without
any other care than to compose my thoughts, and regulate my
hours by a constant succession of innocent occupations, till
with a mind purified from all earthly desires, I shall enter into
that state to which all are hastening, and in which I hope again
to enjoy the friendship of Pekuah.”</p>

<p>“Do not entangle your mind,” said Imlac, “by irrevocable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
determinations, nor increase the burden of life by a voluntary
accumulation of misery: the weariness of retirement will continue
or increase when the loss of Pekuah is forgotten. That you have
been deprived of one pleasure is no very good reason for rejection
of the rest.”</p>

<p>“Since Pekuah was taken from me,” said the princess, “I
have no pleasure to reject or to retain. She that has no one to
love or trust has little to hope. She wants the radical principle
of happiness. We may, perhaps, allow that what satisfaction
this world can afford must arise from the conjunction of wealth,
knowledge, and goodness: wealth is nothing but as it is bestowed,
and knowledge nothing but as it is communicated; they must
therefore be imparted to others, and to whom could I now delight
to impart them? Goodness affords the only comfort which can
be enjoyed without a partner, and goodness may be practised
in retirement.”</p>

<p>“How far solitude may admit goodness or advance it, I shall
not,” replied Imlac, “dispute at present. Remember the confession
of the pious hermit. You will wish to return into the
world, when the image of your companion has left your
thoughts.” “That time,” said Nekayah, “will never come.
The generous frankness, the modest obsequiousness, and the
faithful secrecy of my dear Pekuah, will always be more missed,
as I shall live longer to see vice and folly.”</p>

<p>“The state of a mind oppressed with a sudden calamity,”
said Imlac, “is like that of the fabulous inhabitants of the
new-created earth, who, when the first night came upon them,
supposed that day would never return. When the clouds of
sorrow gather over us, we see nothing beyond them, nor can
imagine how they will be dispelled; yet a new day succeeded
to the night, and sorrow is never long without a dawn of ease.
But they who restrain themselves from receiving comfort do as
the savages would have done, had they put out their eyes when
it was dark. Our minds, like our bodies, are in continual flux;
something is hourly lost, and something acquired. To lose
much at once is inconvenient to either, but while the vital
powers remain uninjured, nature will find the means of reparation.
Distance has the same effect on the mind as on the eye, and while
we glide along the stream of time, whatever we leave behind
us is always lessening, and that which we approach increasing,
in magnitude. Do not suffer life to stagnate; it will grow muddy
for want of motion; commit yourself again to the current of the
world; Pekuah will vanish by degrees: you will meet in your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
way some other favourite, or learn to diffuse yourself in general
conversation.”</p>

<p>“At least,” said the prince, “do not despair before all remedies
have been tried; the inquiry after the unfortunate lady is still
continued, and shall be carried on with yet greater diligence, on
condition that you will promise to wait a year for the event,
without any unalterable resolution.”</p>

<p>Nekayah thought this a reasonable demand, and made the
promise to her brother, who had been advised by Imlac to
require it. Imlac had, indeed, no great hope of regaining
Pekuah; but he supposed, that if he could secure the interval of
a year, the princess would be then in no danger of a cloister.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">PEKUAH IS STILL REMEMBERED. THE PROGRESS OF SORROW</span></h3>

<p>Nekayah, seeing that nothing was omitted for the recovery of
her favourite, and having, by her promise, set her intention of
retirement at a distance, began imperceptibly to return to
common cares and common pleasures. She rejoiced without
her own consent at the suspension of her sorrows, and sometimes
caught herself with indignation in the act of turning away her
mind from the remembrance of her, whom yet she resolved never
to forget.</p>

<p>She then appointed a certain hour of the day for meditation
on the merits and fondness of Pekuah, and for some weeks retired
constantly at the time fixed, and returned with her eyes swollen
and her countenance clouded. By degrees she grew less scrupulous,
and suffered any important and pressing avocation to delay
the tribute of daily tears. She then yielded to less occasions;
sometimes forgot what she was indeed afraid to remember, and
at last wholly released herself from the duty of periodical
affliction.</p>

<p>Her real love of Pekuah was yet not diminished. A thousand
occurrences brought her back to memory, and a thousand wants,
which nothing but the confidence of friendship can supply, made
her frequently regretted. She therefore solicited Imlac never
to desist from inquiry, and to leave no art of intelligence untried,
that at least she might have the comfort of knowing that she
did not suffer by negligence or sluggishness. “Yet what,” said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
she, “is to be expected from our pursuit of happiness, when we
find the state of life to be such, that happiness itself is the cause
of misery? Why should we endeavour to attain that of which
the possession cannot be secured? I shall henceforward fear
to yield my heart to excellence however bright, or to fondness
however tender, lest I should lose again what I have lost in
Pekuah.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCESS HEARS NEWS OF PEKUAH</span></h3>

<p>In seven months, one of the messengers, who had been sent
away upon the day when the promise was drawn from the
princess, returned, after many unsuccessful rambles, from the
borders of Nubia, with an account that Pekuah was in the hands
of an Arab chief, who possessed a castle or fortress on the
extremity of Egypt. The Arab, whose revenue was plunder,
was willing to restore her, with her two attendants, for two
hundred ounces of gold.</p>

<p>The price was no subject of debate. The princess was in
ecstasies, when she heard that her favourite was alive, and might
so cheaply be ransomed. She could not think of delaying for a
moment Pekuah’s happiness or her own, but entreated her
brother to send back the messenger with the sum required.
Imlac, being consulted, was not very confident of the veracity
of the relater, and was still more doubtful of the Arab’s faith,
who might, if he were too liberally trusted, detain at once the
money and the captives. He thought it dangerous to put themselves
in the power of the Arab, by going into his district, and
could not expect that the rover would so much expose himself
as to come into the lower country, where he might be seized by
the forces of the Bassa.</p>

<p>It is difficult to negotiate where neither will trust. But
Imlac, after some deliberation, directed the messenger to propose
that Pekuah should be conducted by ten horsemen to the
monastery of St. Antony, which is situated in the deserts of
Upper Egypt, where she should be met by the same number,
and her ransom should be paid.</p>

<p>That no time might be lost, as they expected that the proposal
would not be refused, they immediately began their journey to
the monastery; and when they arrived, Imlac went forward with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the former messenger to the Arab’s fortress. Rasselas was
desirous to go with them, but neither his sister nor Imlac would
consent. The Arab, according to the custom of his nation,
observed the laws of hospitality with great exactness to those
who put themselves into his power, and, in a few days, brought
Pekuah with her maids, by easy journeys, to their place
appointed, where, receiving the stipulated price, he restored
her with great respect to liberty and her friends, and undertook
to conduct them back towards Cairo, beyond all danger of
robbery or violence.</p>

<p>The princess and her favourite embraced each other with
transport too violent to be expressed, and went out together to
pour the tears of tenderness in secret, and exchange professions
of kindness and gratitude. After a few hours they returned
into the refectory of the convent, where, in the presence of the
prior and his brethren, the prince required of Pekuah the history
of her adventures.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH</span></h3>

<p>“At what time and in what manner I was forced away,” said
Pekuah, “your servants have told you. The suddenness of the
event struck me with surprise, and I was at first rather stupefied
than agitated with any passion of either fear or sorrow. My
confusion was increased by the speed and tumult of our flight,
while we were followed by the Turks, who, as it seemed, soon
despaired to overtake us, or were afraid of those whom they
made a show of menacing.</p>

<p>“When the Arabs saw themselves out of danger, they
slackened their course; and as I was less harassed by external
violence, I began to feel more uneasiness in my mind. After
some time, we stopped near a spring shaded with trees in a
pleasant meadow, where we were set upon the ground, and
offered such refreshments as our masters were partaking. I
was suffered to sit with my maids apart from the rest, and
none attempted to comfort or insult us. Here I first began to
feel the full weight of my misery. The girls sat weeping in
silence, and from time to time looked on me for succour. I knew
not to what condition we were doomed, nor could conjecture
where would be the place of our captivity, or whence to draw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
any hope of deliverance. I was in the hands of robbers and
savages, and had no reason to suppose that their pity was more
than their justice, or that they would forbear the gratification
of any ardour of desire, or caprice of cruelty. I, however,
kissed my maids, and endeavoured to pacify them by remarking
that we were yet treated with decency, and that, since we were
now carried beyond pursuit, there was no danger of violence
to our lives.</p>

<p>“When we were to be set again on horseback, my maids
clung round me, and refused to be parted; but I commanded
them not to irritate those who had us in their power. We
travelled the remaining part of the day through an unfrequented
and pathless country, and came by moonlight to the
side of a hill, where the rest of the troop were stationed. Their
tents were pitched and their fires kindled, and our chief was
welcomed as a man much beloved by his dependants.</p>

<p>“We were received into a large tent, where we found women
who had attended their husbands in the expedition. They set
before us the supper which they had provided, and I ate rather
to encourage my maids, than to comply with any appetite of
my own. When the meat was taken away, they spread the
carpets for repose. I was weary, and hoped to find in sleep that
remission of distress which nature seldom denies. Ordering
myself therefore to be undressed, I observed that the women
looked very earnestly upon me, not expecting, I suppose, to
see me so submissively attended. When my upper vest was
taken off, they were apparently struck with the splendour of
my clothes, and one of them timorously laid her hand upon
the embroidery. She then went out, and in a short time came
back with another woman, who seemed to be of higher rank
and greater authority. She did, at her entrance, the usual
act of reverence, and taking me by the hand, placed me in a
smaller tent, spread with finer carpets, where I spent the night
quietly with my maids.</p>

<p>“In the morning, as I was sitting on the grass, the chief of
the troop came towards me. I rose up to receive him, and he
bowed with great respect. ‘Illustrious lady,’ said he, ‘my
fortune is better than I had presumed to hope: I am told by my
women that I have a princess in my camp.’ ‘Sir,’ answered I,
‘your women have deceived themselves and you; I am not a
princess, but an unhappy stranger, who intended soon to have
left this country, in which I am now to be imprisoned for ever.’
‘Whoever or whencesoever you are,’ returned the Arab, ‘your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
dress, and that of your servants, show your rank to be high
and your wealth to be great. Why should you, who can so
easily procure your ransom, think yourself in danger of perpetual
captivity? The purpose of my incursions is to increase
my riches, or, more properly, to gather tribute. The sons of
Ishmael are the natural and hereditary lords of this part of the
continent, which is usurped by late invaders and low-born
tyrants, from whom we are compelled to take by the sword what
is denied to justice. The violence of war admits no distinction;
the lance that is lifted at guilt and power will sometimes fall on
innocence and gentleness.’</p>

<p>“‘How little,’ said I, ‘did I expect that yesterday it should
have fallen upon me!’</p>

<p>“‘Misfortunes,’ answered the Arab, ‘should always be expected.
If the eye of hostility could learn reverence or pity,
excellence like yours had been exempt from injury. But the
angels of affliction spread their toils alike for the virtuous and
the wicked, for the mighty and the mean. Do not be disconsolate:
I am not one of the lawless and cruel rovers of the
desert; I know the rules of civil life; I will fix your ransom,
give a passport to your messenger, and perform my stipulation
with nice punctuality.’</p>

<p>“You will easily believe that I was pleased with his courtesy:
and finding that his predominant passion was desire of money,
I began now to think my danger less, for I knew that no sum
would be thought too great for the release of Pekuah. I told
him that he should have no reason to charge me with ingratitude,
if I was used with kindness, and that any ransom which
could be expected for a maid of common rank would be paid;
but that he must not persist to rate me as a princess. He said
he would consider what he should demand, and then smiling,
bowed and retired.</p>

<p>“Soon after, the women came about me, each contending to
be more officious than the other, and my maids themselves
were served with reverence. We travelled onward by short
journeys. On the fourth day, the chief told me that my ransom
must be two hundred ounces of gold; which I not only
promised him, but told him that I would add fifty more, if
I and my maids were honourably treated.</p>

<p>“I never knew the power of gold before. From that time
I was the leader of the troop. The march of every day
was longer or shorter as I commanded, and the tents were
pitched where I chose to rest. We now had camels and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
conveniences for travel; my own women were always at my
side; and I amused myself with observing the manners of the
vagrant nations, and with viewing remains of ancient edifices,
with which these deserted countries appear to have been, in
some distant age, lavishly embellished.</p>

<p>“The chief of the band was a man far from illiterate: he was
able to travel by the stars or the compass, and had marked,
in his erratic expeditions, such places as are most worthy the
notice of a passenger. He observed to me, that buildings are
always best preserved in places little frequented and difficult
of access: for, when once a country declines from its primitive
splendour, the more inhabitants are left, the quicker ruin will
be made. Walls supply stones more easily than quarries, and
palaces and temples will be demolished, to make stables of
granite and cottages of porphyry.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED</span></h3>

<p>“We wandered about in this manner for some weeks, whether, as
our chief pretended, for my gratification, or, as I rather suspected,
for some convenience of his own. I endeavoured to appear
contented, where sullenness and resentment would have been of
no use, and that endeavour conduced much to the calmness of
my mind; but my heart was always with Nekayah, and the
troubles of the night much overbalanced the amusements of
the day. My women, who threw all their cares upon their
mistress, set their minds at ease from the time when they saw
me treated with respect, and gave themselves up to the incidental
alleviations of our fatigue without solicitude or sorrow.
I was pleased with their pleasure, and animated with their
confidence. My condition had lost much of its terror, since I
found that the Arab ranged the country merely to get riches.
Avarice is an uniform and tractable vice: other intellectual
distempers are different in different constitutions of mind; that
which soothes the pride of one will offend the pride of another;
but to the favour of the covetous there is a ready way; bring
money, and nothing is denied.</p>

<p>“At last we came to the dwelling of our chief, a strong and
spacious house built with stone in an island of the Nile, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
lies, as I was told, under the tropic. ‘Lady,’ said the Arab,
‘you shall rest after your journey a few weeks in this place,
where you are to consider yourself as sovereign. My occupation
is war: I have therefore chosen this obscure residence, from which
I can issue unexpected, and to which I can retire unpursued.
You may now repose in security; here are few pleasures, but
here is no danger.’ He then led me into the inner apartments,
and seating me on the richest couch, bowed to the ground.
His women, who considered me as a rival, looked on me with
malignity; but being soon informed that I was a great lady
detained only for my ransom, they began to vie with each other
in obsequiousness and reverence.</p>

<p>“Being again comforted with new assurances of speedy
liberty, I was for some days diverted from impatience by the
novelty of the place. The turrets overlooked the country to
a great distance, and afforded a view of many windings of the
stream. In the day I wandered from one place to another as
the course of the sun varied the splendour of the prospect,
and saw many things which I had never seen before. The
crocodiles and river-horses are common in this unpeopled region,
and I often looked upon them with terror, though I knew that
they could not hurt me. For some time I expected to see mermaids
and tritons, which, as Imlac has told me, the European
travellers have stationed in the Nile; but no such beings ever
appeared, and the Arab, when I inquired after them, laughed
at my credulity.</p>

<p>“At night the Arab always attended me to a tower set apart
for celestial observations, where he endeavoured to teach me
the names and courses of the stars. I had no great inclination
to this study, but an appearance of attention was necessary
to please my instructor, who valued himself for his skill; and,
in a little while, I found some employment requisite to beguile
the tediousness of time, which was to be passed always amidst
the same objects. I was weary of looking in the morning on
things from which I had turned away weary in the evening; I
therefore was at last willing to observe the stars rather than do
nothing, but could not always compose my thoughts, and was
very often thinking on Nekayah, when others imagined me
contemplating the sky. Soon after, the Arab went upon another
expedition, and then my only pleasure was to talk with my
maids about the accident by which we were carried away,
and the happiness that we should all enjoy at the end of our
captivity.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“There were women in your Arab’s fortress,” said the
princess: “why did you not make them your companions, enjoy
their conversation, and partake their diversions? In a place
where they found business or amusement, why should you
alone sit corroded with idle melancholy? or why could not you
bear for a few months that condition to which they were
condemned for life?”</p>

<p>“The diversions of the women,” answered Pekuah, “were
only childish play, by which the mind accustomed to stronger
operations could not be kept busy. I could do all which they
delighted in doing, by powers merely sensitive, while my intellectual
faculties were flown to Cairo. They ran from room to
room, as a bird hops from wire to wire in his cage. They
danced for the sake of motion, as lambs frisk in a meadow.
One sometimes pretended to be hurt, that the rest might be
alarmed; or hid herself, that another might seek her. Part of
their time passed in watching the progress of light bodies that
floated on the river, and part in marking the various forms into
which clouds broke in the sky.</p>

<p>“Their business was only needlework, in which I and my
maids sometimes helped them; but you know that the mind
will easily straggle from the fingers, nor will you suspect that
captivity and absence from Nekayah could receive solace from
silken flowers.</p>

<p>“Nor was much satisfaction to be hoped from their conversation:
for of what could they be expected to talk? They
had seen nothing, for they had lived from early youth in that
narrow spot; of what they had not seen they could have no
knowledge, for they could not read. They had no ideas but
of the few things that were within their view, and had hardly
names for anything but their clothes and their food. As I
bore a superior character, I was often called to terminate their
quarrels, which I decided as equitably as I could. If it could
have amused me to hear the complaints of each against the
rest, I might have been often detained by long stories; but the
motives of their animosity were so small, that I could not listen
without intercepting the tale.”</p>

<p>“How,” said Rasselas, “can the Arab, whom you represented
as a man of more than common accomplishments, take any
pleasure in his seraglio, when it is filled only with women like
these? Are they exquisitely beautiful?”</p>

<p>“They do not,” said Pekuah, “want that unaffecting and
ignoble beauty which may subsist without sprightliness or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sublimity, without energy of thought or dignity of virtue. But
to a man like the Arab such beauty was only a flower casually
plucked and carelessly thrown away. Whatever pleasures he
might find among them, they were not those of friendship or
society. When they were playing about him, he looked on them
with inattentive superiority; when they vied for his regard, he
sometimes turned away disgusted. As they had no knowledge,
their talk could take nothing from the tediousness of life; as
they had no choice, their fondness, or appearance of fondness,
excited in him neither pride nor gratitude; he was not exalted
in his own esteem by the smiles of a woman who saw no other
man, nor was much obliged by that regard, of which he could
never know the sincerity, and which he might often perceive to
be exerted, not so much to delight him as to pain a rival. That
which he gave and they received as love, was only a careless
distribution of superfluous time, such love as man can bestow
upon that which he despises, such as has neither hope nor fear,
neither joy nor sorrow.”</p>

<p>“You have reason, lady, to think yourself happy,” said Imlac,
“that you have been thus easily dismissed. How could a mind,
hungry for knowledge, be willing, in an intellectual famine, to
lose such a banquet as Pekuah’s conversation?”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to believe,” answered Pekuah, “that he was
for some time in suspense; for, notwithstanding his promise,
whenever I proposed to dispatch a messenger to Cairo, he
found some excuse for delay. While I was detained in his
house, he made many incursions into the neighbouring countries;
and perhaps he would have refused to discharge me, had his
plunder been equal to his wishes. He returned always courteous,
related his adventures, delighted to hear my observations, and
endeavoured to advance my acquaintance with the stars. When
I importuned him to send away my letters, he soothed me
with professions of honour and sincerity; and, when I could be
no longer decently denied, put his troop again in motion, and
left me to govern in his absence. I was much afflicted by
this studied procrastination, and was sometimes afraid that
I should be forgotten; that you would leave Cairo, and I must
end my days in an island of the Nile.</p>

<p>“I grew at last hopeless and dejected, and cared so little
to entertain him, that he for a while more frequently talked
with my maids. That he should fall in love with them or
with me might have been equally fatal, and I was not much
pleased with the growing friendship. My anxiety was not long;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for, as I recovered some degree of cheerfulness, he returned to
me, and I could not forbear to despise my former uneasiness.</p>

<p>“He still delayed to send for my ransom, and would, perhaps,
never have determined, had not your agent found his way to
him. The gold, which he would not fetch, he could not reject
when it was offered. He hastened to prepare for our journey
hither, like a man delivered from the pain of an intestine
conflict. I took leave of my companions in the house, who
dismissed me with cold indifference.”</p>

<p>Nekayah, having heard her favourite’s relation, rose and
embraced her, and Rasselas gave her an hundred ounces of
gold, which she presented to the Arab for the fifty that were
promised.</p>

<p>They returned to Cairo, and were so well pleased at finding
themselves together, that none of them went much abroad.
The prince began to love learning, and one day declared to
Imlac, that he intended to devote himself to science, and pass
the rest of his days in literary solitude.</p>

<p>“Before you make your final choice,” answered Imlac, “you
ought to examine its hazards, and converse with some of those
who are grown old in the company of themselves. I have just
left the observatory of one of the most learned astronomers in
the world, who has spent forty years in unwearied attention to
the motions and appearances of the celestial bodies, and has
drawn out his soul in endless calculations. He admits a few
friends once a month, to hear his deductions and enjoy his
discoveries. I was introduced as a man of knowledge worthy
of his notice. Men of various ideas and fluent conversation are
commonly welcome to those whose thoughts have been long
fixed upon a single point, and who find the images of other
things stealing away. I delighted him with my remarks; he
smiled at the narrative of my travels, and was glad to forget the
constellations, and descend for a moment into the lower world.</p>

<p>“On the next day of vacation I renewed my visit, and was
so fortunate as to please him again. He relaxed from that
time the severity of his rule, and permitted me to enter at
my own choice. I found him always busy, and always glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to be relieved. As each knew much which the other was
desirous of learning, we exchanged our notions with great
delight. I perceived that I had every day more of his confidence,
and always found new cause of admiration in the
profundity of his mind. His comprehension is vast, his memory
capacious and retentive, his discourse is methodical, and his
expression clear.</p>

<p>“His integrity and benevolence are equal to his learning.
His deepest researches and most favourite studies are willingly
interrupted for any opportunity of doing good by his counsel
or his riches. To his closest retreat, at his most busy moments,
all are admitted that want his assistance: ‘For though I exclude
idleness and pleasure, I will never,’ says he, ‘bar my doors
against charity. To man is permitted the contemplation of
the skies, but the practice of virtue is commanded.’”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the princess, “this man is happy.”</p>

<p>“I visited him,” said Imlac, “with more and more frequency,
and was every time more enamoured of his conversation; he
was sublime without haughtiness, courteous without formality,
and communicative without ostentation. I was at first, great
princess, of your opinion, thought him the happiest of mankind,
and often congratulated him on the blessing that he enjoyed.
He seemed to hear nothing with indifference but the praises of
his condition, to which he always returned a general answer,
and diverted the conversation to some other topic.</p>

<p>“Amidst this willingness to be pleased and labour to please,
I had quickly reason to imagine that some painful sentiment
pressed upon his mind. He often looked up earnestly towards
the sun, and let his voice fall in the midst of his discourse. He
would sometimes, when we were alone, gaze upon me in silence,
with the air of a man who longed to speak what he was yet
resolved to suppress. He would often send for me with vehement
injunctions of haste, though, when I came to him, he had
nothing extraordinary to say; and sometimes, when I was
leaving him, would call me back, pause a few moments, and
then dismiss me.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE ASTRONOMER DISCOVERS THE CAUSE OF HIS UNEASINESS</span></h3>

<p>“At last the time came when the secret burst his reserve. We
were sitting together last night in the turret of his house,
watching the emersion of a satellite of Jupiter. A sudden
tempest clouded the sky, and disappointed our observation.
We sat awhile silent in the dark, and then he addressed himself
to me in these words: ‘Imlac, I have long considered thy
friendship as the greatest blessing of my life. Integrity without
knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without
integrity is dangerous and dreadful. I have found in thee all
the qualities requisite for trust, benevolence, experience, and
fortitude. I have long discharged an office which I must soon
quit at the call of nature, and shall rejoice in the hour of
imbecility and pain to devolve it upon thee.’</p>

<p>“I thought myself honoured by this testimony, and protested,
that whatever could conduce to his happiness would
add likewise to mine.</p>

<p>“‘Hear, Imlac, what thou wilt not without difficulty credit.
I have possessed for five years the regulation of weather, and
the distribution of the seasons; the sun has listened to my
dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction;
the clouds, at my call, have poured their waters, and the Nile
has overflowed at my command; I have restrained the rage of
the dog-star, and mitigated the fervours of the Crab. The
winds alone, of all the elemental powers, have hitherto refused
my authority, and multitudes have perished by equinoctial
tempests, which I found myself unable to prohibit or restrain.
I have administered this great office with exact justice, and
made to the different nations of the earth an impartial dividend
of rain and sunshine. What must have been the misery of half
the globe, if I had limited the clouds to particular regions, or
confined the sun to either side of the equator?’”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE OPINION OF THE ASTRONOMER IS EXPLAINED AND JUSTIFIED</span></h3>

<p>“I suppose he discovered in me, through the obscurity of the
room, some tokens of amazement and doubt, for, after a short
pause, he proceeded thus:</p>

<p>“‘Not to be easily credited will neither surprise nor offend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
me; for I am, probably, the first of human beings to whom this
trust has been imparted. Nor do I know whether to deem this
distinction a reward or punishment; since I have possessed it,
I have been far less happy than before, and nothing but the
consciousness of good intention could have enabled me to
support the weariness of unremitted vigilance.’</p>

<p>“‘How long, sir,’ said I, ‘has this great office been in your
hands?’</p>

<p>“‘About ten years ago,’ said he, ‘my daily observations of
the changes of the sky led me to consider, whether, if I had
the power of the seasons, I could confer greater plenty upon
the inhabitants of the earth. This contemplation fastened on
my mind, and I sat days and nights in imaginary dominion,
pouring upon this country and that the showers of fertility,
and seconding every fall of rain with a due proportion of sunshine.
I had yet only the will to do good, and did not imagine
that I should ever have the power.</p>

<p>“‘One day, as I was looking on the fields withering with
heat, I felt in my mind a sudden wish that I could send rain on
the southern mountains, and raise the Nile to an inundation.
In the hurry of my imagination I commanded rain to fall;
and by comparing the time of my command with that of the
inundation, I found that the clouds had listened to my lips.’</p>

<p>“‘Might not some other cause,’ said I, ‘produce this concurrence?
the Nile does not always rise on the same day.’</p>

<p>“‘Do not believe,’ said he with impatience, ‘that such
objections could escape me: I reasoned long against my own
conviction, and laboured against truth with the utmost obstinacy.
I sometimes suspected myself of madness, and should
not have dared to impart this secret but to a man like you,
capable of distinguishing the wonderful from the impossible,
and the incredible from the false.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, sir,’ said I, ‘do you call that incredible, which you
know, or think you know, to be true?’</p>

<p>“‘Because,’ said he, ‘I cannot prove it by any external
evidence; and I know too well the laws of demonstration to
think that my conviction ought to influence another, who
cannot like me be conscious of its force. I therefore shall not
attempt to gain credit by disputation. It is sufficient that I
feel this power, that I have long possessed, and every day
exerted it. But the life of man is short, the infirmities of
age increase upon me, and the time will soon come, when the
regulator of the year must mingle with the dust. The care of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
appointing a successor has long disturbed me; the night and
the day have been spent in comparisons of all the characters
which have come to my knowledge, and I have yet found none
so worthy as thyself.’”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE ASTRONOMER LEAVES IMLAC HIS DIRECTIONS</span></h3>

<p>“‘Hear, therefore, what I shall impart, with attention such as
the welfare of a world requires. If the task of a king be considered
as difficult, who has the care only of a few millions, to
whom he cannot do much good or harm, what must be the
anxiety of him on whom depends the action of the elements,
and the great gifts of light and heat! Hear me therefore
with attention.</p>

<p>“‘I have diligently considered the position of the earth and
sun, and formed innumerable schemes in which I changed their
situation. I have sometimes turned aside the axis of the
earth, and sometimes varied the ecliptic of the sun; but I
have found it impossible to make a disposition by which the
world may be advantaged; what one region gains, another
loses, by any imaginable alteration, even without considering
the distant parts of the solar system with which we are unacquainted.
Do not, therefore, in thy administration of the
year, indulge thy pride by innovation; do not please thyself
with thinking that thou canst make thyself renowned to all
future ages by disordering the seasons. The memory of mischief
is no desirable fame. Much less will it become thee to
let kindness or interest prevail. Never rob other countries of
rain to pour it on thine own. For us the Nile is sufficient.’</p>

<p>“I promised, that when I possessed the power, I would use
it with inflexible integrity; and he dismissed me, pressing my
hand. ‘My heart,’ said he, ‘will be now at rest, and my
benevolence will no more destroy my quiet; I have found a man
of wisdom and virtue, to whom I can cheerfully bequeath the
inheritance of the sun.’”</p>

<p>The prince heard this narration with very serious regard;
but the princess smiled, and Pekuah convulsed herself with
laughter. “Ladies,” said Imlac, “to mock the heaviest of
human afflictions is neither charitable nor wise. Few can
attain this man’s knowledge, and few practise his virtues;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
but all may suffer his calamity. Of the uncertainties of our
present state, the most dreadful and alarming is the uncertain
continuance of reason.”</p>

<p>The princess was recollected, and the favourite was abashed.
Rasselas, more deeply affected, inquired of Imlac, whether
he thought such maladies of the mind frequent, and how they
were contracted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE DANGEROUS PREVALENCE OF IMAGINATION</span></h3>

<p>“Disorders of intellect,” answered Imlac, “happen much more
often than superficial observers will easily believe. Perhaps, if
we speak with rigorous exactness, no human mind is in its
right state. There is no man whose imagination does not
sometimes predominate over his reason, who can regulate his
attention wholly by his will, and whose ideas will come and go
at his command. No man will be found in whose mind airy
notions do not sometimes tyrannize, and force him to hope or
fear beyond the limits of sober probability. All power of fancy
over reason is a degree of insanity; but while this power is such
as we can control and repress, it is not visible to others, nor
considered as any depravation of the mental faculties: it is not
pronounced madness but when it becomes ungovernable and
apparently influences speech or action.</p>

<p>“To indulge the power of fiction, and send imagination out
upon the wing, is often the sport of those who delight too much
in silent speculation. When we are alone we are not always
busy; the labour of excogitation is too violent to last long;
the ardour of inquiry will sometimes give way to idleness or
satiety. He who has nothing external that can divert him,
must find pleasure in his own thoughts, and must conceive
himself what he is not; for who is pleased with what he is?
He then expatiates in boundless futurity, and culls from all
imaginable conditions that which for the present moment he
should most desire, amuses his desires with impossible enjoyments,
and confers upon his pride unattainable dominion. The
mind dances from scene to scene, unites all pleasures in all
combinations, and riots in delights, which nature and fortune,
with all their bounty, cannot bestow.</p>

<p>“In time some particular train of ideas fixes the attention;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
all other intellectual gratifications are rejected; the mind, in
weariness or leisure, recurs constantly to the favourite conception,
and feasts on the luscious falsehood whenever she is
offended with the bitterness of truth. By degrees the reign of
fancy is confirmed; she grows first imperious, and in time
despotic. Then fictions begin to operate as realities, false
opinions fasten upon the mind, and life passes in dreams of
rapture or of anguish.</p>

<p>“This, sir, is one of the dangers of solitude, which the hermit
has confessed not always to promote goodness, and the astronomer’s
misery has proved to be not always propitious to
wisdom.”</p>

<p>“I will no more,” said the favourite, “imagine myself the
queen of Abyssinia. I have often spent the hours which the
princess gave to my own disposal, in adjusting ceremonies and
regulating the court; I have repressed the pride of the powerful
and granted the petitions of the poor; I have built new palaces
in more happy situations, planted groves upon the tops of mountains,
and have exulted in the beneficence of royalty, till, when
the princess entered, I had almost forgotten to bow down
before her.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said the princess, “will not allow myself any more
to play the shepherdess in my waking dreams. I have often
soothed my thoughts with the quiet and innocence of pastoral
employments, till I have in my chamber heard the winds
whistle, and the sheep bleat; sometimes freed the lamb entangled
in the thicket, and sometimes with my crook encountered the
wolf. I have a dress like that of the village maids, which I put
on to help my imagination, and a pipe on which I play softly,
and suppose myself followed by my flocks.”</p>

<p>“I will confess,” said the prince, “an indulgence of fantastic
delight more dangerous than yours. I have frequently endeavoured
to image the possibility of a perfect government,
by which all wrong should be restrained, all vice reformed, and
all the subjects preserved in tranquillity and innocence. This
thought produced innumerable schemes of reformation, and
dictated many useful regulations and salutary edicts. This
has been the sport, and sometimes the labour, of my solitude;
and I start when I think with how little anguish I once supposed
the death of my father and my brothers.”</p>

<p>“Such,” says Imlac, “are the effects of visionary schemes.
When we first form them, we know them to be absurd, but
familiarize them by degrees, and in time lose sight of their folly.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLV<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN</span></h3>

<p>The evening was now far past, and they rose to return home.
As they walked along the bank of the Nile, delighted with the
beams of the moon quivering on the water, they saw at a small
distance an old man, whom the prince had often heard in the
assembly of the sages. “Yonder,” said he, “is one whose
years have calmed his passions, but not clouded his reason;
let us close the disquisitions of the night, by inquiring what
are his sentiments of his own state, that we may know whether
youth alone is to struggle with vexation, and whether any
better hope remains for the latter part of life.”</p>

<p>Here the sage approached and saluted them. They invited
him to join their walk, and prattled awhile, as acquaintance
that had unexpectedly met one another. The old man was
cheerful and talkative, and the way seemed short in his company.
He was pleased to find himself not disregarded, accompanied
them to their house, and, at the prince’s request, entered with
them. They placed him in the seat of honour, and set wine
and conserves before him.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the princess, “an evening walk must give to a
man of learning, like you, pleasures which ignorance and youth
can hardly conceive. You know the qualities and the causes
of all that you behold, the laws by which the river flows, the
periods in which the planets perform their revolutions. Everything
must supply you with contemplation, and renew the
consciousness of your own dignity.”</p>

<p>“Lady,” answered he, “let the gay and the vigorous expect
pleasure in their excursions; it is enough that age can obtain
ease. To me the world has lost its novelty: I look round, and
see what I remember to have seen in happier days. I rest
against a tree, and consider, that in the same shade I once
disputed upon the annual overflow of the Nile with a friend
who is now silent in the grave. I cast my eyes upwards,
fix them on the changing moon, and think with pain on the
vicissitudes of life. I have ceased to take much delight in
physical truth; for what have I to do with those things which
I am soon to leave?”</p>

<p>“You may at least recreate yourself,” said Imlac, “with
the recollection of an honourable and useful life, and enjoy
the praise which all agree to give you.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
“Praise,” said the sage with a sigh, “is to an old man an
empty sound. I have neither mother to be delighted with the
reputation of her son, nor wife to partake the honours of her
husband. I have outlived my friends and my rivals. Nothing
is now of much importance; for I cannot extend my interest
beyond myself. Youth is delighted with applause, because it
is considered as the earnest of some future good, and because
the prospect of life is far extended; but to me, who am now
declining to decrepitude, there is little to be feared from the
malevolence of men, and yet less to be hoped from their affection
or esteem. Something they may yet take away, but they can
give me nothing. Riches would now be useless, and high
employment would be pain. My retrospect of life recalls to
my view many opportunities of good neglected, much time
squandered upon trifles, and more lost in idleness and vacancy.
I leave many great designs unattempted, and many great
attempts unfinished. My mind is burdened with no heavy
crime, and therefore I compose myself to tranquillity; endeavour
to abstract my thoughts from hopes and cares, which, though
reason knows them to be vain, still try to keep their old possession
of the heart; expect, with serene humility, that hour which
nature cannot long delay; and hope to possess, in a better
state, that happiness which here I could not find, and that
virtue which here I have not attained.”</p>

<p>He rose and went away, leaving his audience not much elated
with the hope of long life. The prince consoled himself with
remarking, that it was not reasonable to be disappointed by
this account, for age had never been considered as the season
of felicity, and if it was possible to be easy in decline and
weakness, it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity
might be happy; that the noon of life might be bright, if the
evening could be calm.</p>

<p>The princess suspected that age was querulous and malignant,
and delighted to repress the expectations of those who had
newly entered the world. She had seen the possessors of
estates look with envy on their heirs, and known many who enjoyed
pleasure no longer than they can confine it to themselves.</p>

<p>Pekuah conjectured that the man was older than he appeared,
and was willing to impute his complaints to delirious dejection;
or else supposed that he had been unfortunate, and was therefore
discontented: “For nothing,” said she, “is more common,
than to call our own condition the condition of life.”</p>

<p>Imlac, who had no desire to see them depressed, smiled at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the comforts which they could so readily procure to themselves,
and remembered, that at the same age he was equally confident
of unmingled prosperity, and equally fertile of consolatory
expedients. He forbore to force upon them unwelcome knowledge,
which time itself would too soon impress. The princess
and her lady retired; the madness of the astronomer hung upon
their minds, and they desired Imlac to enter upon his office,
and delay next morning the rising of the sun.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER</span></h3>

<p>The princess and Pekuah having talked in private of Imlac’s
astronomer, thought his character at once so amiable and so
strange, that they could not be satisfied without a nearer
knowledge; and Imlac was requested to find the means of
bringing them together.</p>

<p>This was somewhat difficult: the philosopher had never
received any visits from women, though he lived in a city
that had in it many Europeans, who followed the manners of
their own countries, and many from other parts of the world,
that lived there with European liberty. The ladies would not
be refused, and several schemes were proposed for the accomplishment
of their design. It was proposed to introduce them as
strangers in distress, to whom the sage was always accessible;
but, after some deliberation, it appeared that by this artifice no
acquaintance could be formed, for their conversation would
be short, and they could not decently importune him often.
“This,” said Rasselas, “is true; but I have yet a stronger
objection against the misrepresentation of your state. I have
always considered it as treason against the great republic of
human nature, to make any man’s virtues the means of deceiving
him, whether on great or little occasions. All imposture
weakens confidence, and chills benevolence. When the sage
finds that you are not what you seemed, he will feel the resentment
natural to a man who, conscious of great abilities, discovers
that he has been tricked by understandings meaner than his
own, and, perhaps, the distrust which he can never afterwards
wholly lay aside, may stop the voice of counsel and close
the hand of charity; and where will you find the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of restoring his benefactions to mankind, or his peace to
himself?”</p>

<p>To this no reply was attempted, and Imlac began to hope
that their curiosity would subside; but, next day, Pekuah told
him, she had now found an honest pretence for a visit to the
astronomer, for she would solicit permission to continue under
him the studies in which she had been initiated by the Arab,
and the princess might go with her either as a fellow-student,
or because a woman could not decently come alone. “I am
afraid,” said Imlac, “that he will be soon weary of your company;
men advanced far in knowledge do not love to repeat the
elements of their art, and I am not certain that even of the
elements, as he will deliver them, connected with inferences and
mingled with reflections, you are a very capable auditress.”
“That,” said Pekuah, “must be my care; I ask of you only to
take me thither. My knowledge is, perhaps, more than you
imagine it; and, by concurring always with his opinions, I
shall make him think it greater than it is.”</p>

<p>The astronomer, in pursuance of this resolution, was told
that a foreign lady, travelling in search of knowledge, had
heard of his reputation, and was desirous to become his scholar.
The uncommonness of the proposal raised at once his surprise
and curiosity; and when, after a short deliberation, he consented
to admit her, he could not stay without impatience till
the next day.</p>

<p>The ladies dressed themselves magnificently, and were
attended by Imlac to the astronomer, who was pleased to
see himself approached with respect by persons of so splendid
an appearance. In the exchange of the first civilities he was
timorous and bashful; but when the talk became regular, he
recollected his powers, and justified the character which Imlac
had given. Inquiring of Pekuah what could have turned her
inclination towards astronomy, he received from her a history
of her adventure at the Pyramid, and of the time passed in
the Arab’s island. She told her tale with ease and elegance,
and her conversation took possession of his heart. The discourse
was then turned to astronomy: Pekuah displayed what
she knew: he looked upon her as a prodigy of genius, and
entreated her not to desist from a study which she had so
happily begun.</p>

<p>They came again and again, and were every time more
welcome than before. The sage endeavoured to amuse them,
that they might prolong their visits, for he found his thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
grow brighter in their company; the clouds of solicitude vanished
by degrees, as he forced himself to entertain them, and he grieved
when he was left at their departure to his old employment of
regulating the seasons.</p>

<p>The princess and her favourite had now watched his lips
for several months, and could not catch a single word from
which they could judge whether he continued, or not, in the
opinion of his preternatural commission. They often contrived
to bring him to an open declaration; but he easily eluded
all their attacks, and, on which side soever they pressed him,
escaped from them to some other topic.</p>

<p>As their familiarity increased, they invited him often to
the house of Imlac, where they distinguished him by extraordinary
respect. He began gradually to delight in sublunary
pleasures. He came early, and departed late; laboured to
recommend himself by assiduity and compliance; excited their
curiosity after new arts, that they might still want his assistance;
and when they made any excursion of pleasure or inquiry,
entreated to attend them.</p>

<p>By long experience of his integrity and wisdom, the prince
and his sister were convinced that he might be trusted without
danger; and lest he should draw any false hopes from the
civilities which he received, discovered to him their condition,
with the motives of their journey, and required his opinion
on the choice of life.</p>

<p>“Of the various conditions which the world spreads before
you, which you shall prefer,” said the sage, “I am not able to
instruct you. I can only tell that I have chosen wrong. I have
passed my time in study without experience; in the attainment
of sciences which can, for the most part, be but remotely useful
to mankind. I have purchased knowledge at the expense of
all the common comforts of life; I have missed the endearing
elegance of female friendship, and the happy commerce of
domestic tenderness. If I have obtained any prerogatives
above other students, they have been accompanied with fear,
disquiet, and scrupulosity; but even of these prerogatives,
whatever they were, I have, since my thoughts have been
diversified by more intercourse with the world, begun to question
the reality. When I have been for a few days lost in pleasing
dissipation, I am always tempted to think that my inquiries
have ended in error, and that I have suffered much and suffered
it in vain.”</p>

<p>Imlac was delighted to find that the sage’s understanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was breaking through its mists, and resolved to detain him
from the planets till he should forget his task of ruling them,
and reason should recover its original influence.</p>

<p>From this time the astronomer was received into familiar
friendship, and partook of all their projects and pleasures;
his respect kept him attentive, and the activity of Rasselas
did not leave much time unengaged. Something was always
to be done: the day was spent in making observations which
furnished talk for the evening, and the evening was closed
with a scheme for the morrow.</p>

<p>The sage confessed to Imlac, that since he had mingled in
the gay tumults of life, and divided his hours by a succession
of amusements, he found the conviction of his authority over
the skies fade gradually from his mind, and began to trust less
to an opinion which he never could prove to others, and which
he now found subject to variation, from causes in which reason
had no part. “If I am accidentally left alone for a few hours,”
said he, “my inveterate persuasion rushes upon my soul, and
my thoughts are chained down by some irresistible violence;
but they are soon disentangled by the prince’s conversation,
and instantaneously released at the entrance of Pekuah. I am
like a man habitually afraid of spectres, who is set at ease by a
lamp, and wonders at the dread which harassed him in the
dark; yet, if his lamp be extinguished, feels again the terrors
which he knows that when it is light he shall feel no more.
But I am sometimes afraid lest I indulge my quiet by criminal
negligence, and voluntarily forget the great charge with which
I am entrusted. If I favour myself in a known error, or am
determined by my own ease in a doubtful question of this
importance, how dreadful is my crime!”</p>

<p>“No disease of the imagination,” answered Imlac, “is so
difficult of cure as that which is complicated with the dread
of guilt; fancy and conscience then act interchangeably upon
us, and so often shift their places, that the illusions of one are
not distinguished from the dictates of the other. If fancy
presents images not moral or religious, the mind drives them
away when they give it pain; but when melancholic notions
take the form of duty, they lay hold on the faculties without
opposition, because we are afraid to exclude or banish them.
For this reason the superstitious are often melancholy, and
the melancholy almost always superstitious.</p>

<p>“But do not let the suggestions of timidity overpower your
better reason: the danger of neglect can be but as the probability<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the obligation, which, when you consider it with freedom,
you find very little, and that little growing every day less.
Open your heart to the influence of the light which from time to
time breaks in upon you; when scruples importune you, which
you in your lucid moments know to be vain, do not stand to
parley, but fly to business, or to Pekuah, and keep this thought
always prevalent, that you are only one atom of the mass of
humanity, and have neither such virtue nor vice, as that you
should be singled out for supernatural favours or afflictions.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE PRINCE ENTERS, AND BRINGS A NEW TOPIC</span></h3>

<p>“All this,” said the astronomer, “I have often thought, but
my reason has been so long subjugated by an uncontrollable
and overwhelming idea, that it durst not confide in its own
decisions. I now see how fatally I betrayed my quiet, by
suffering chimeras to prey upon me in secret; but melancholy
shrinks from communication, and I never found a man before
to whom I could impart my troubles, though I had been certain
of relief. I rejoice to find my own sentiments confirmed by
yours, who are not easily deceived, and can have no motive
or purpose to deceive. I hope that time and variety will
dissipate the gloom that has so long surrounded me, and the
latter part of my days will be spent in peace.”</p>

<p>“Your learning and virtue,” said Imlac, “may justly give
you hopes.”</p>

<p>Rasselas then entered with the princess and Pekuah, and
inquired, whether they had contrived any new diversion for
the next day. “Such,” said Nekayah, “is the state of life,
that none are happy but by the anticipation of change: the
change itself is nothing; when we have made it, the next wish
is to change again. The world is not yet exhausted; let me
see something to-morrow which I never saw before.”</p>

<p>“Variety,” said Rasselas, “is so necessary to content, that
even the Happy Valley disgusted me by the recurrence of its
luxuries; yet I could not forbear to reproach myself with
impatience, when I saw the monks of St. Anthony support,
without complaint, a life, not of uniform delight, but uniform
hardship.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
“Those men,” answered Imlac, “are less wretched in their
silent convent than the Abyssinian princes in their prison of
pleasure. Whatever is done by the monks is incited by an
adequate and reasonable motive. Their labour supplies them
with necessaries; it therefore cannot be omitted, and is certainly
rewarded. Their devotion prepares them for another state,
and reminds them of its approach while it fits them for it.
Their time is regularly distributed: one duty succeeds another,
so that they are not left open to the distraction of unguided
choice, nor lost in the shades of listless inactivity. There is a
certain task to be performed at an appropriated hour; and their
toils are cheerful, because they consider them as acts of piety
by which they are always advancing towards endless felicity.”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” said Nekayah, “that the monastic rule is
a more holy and less imperfect state than any other? May
not he equally hope for future happiness who converses openly
with mankind, who succours the distressed by his charity,
instructs the ignorant by his learning, and contributes by his
industry to the general system of life; even though he should
omit some of the mortifications which are practised in the
cloister, and allow himself such harmless delights as his
condition may place within his reach?”</p>

<p>“This,” said Imlac, “is a question which has long divided
the wise, and perplexed the good. I am afraid to decide on
either part. He that lives well in the world is better than he
that lives well in a monastery. But, perhaps, every one is not
able to stem the temptations of public life; and if he cannot
conquer, he may properly retreat. Some have little power
to do good, and have likewise little strength to resist evil.
Many are weary of their conflicts with adversity, and are
willing to eject those passions which have long busied them
in vain. And many are dismissed by age and diseases from
the more laborious duties of society. In monasteries, the
weak and timorous may be happily sheltered, the weary may
repose, and the penitent may meditate. Those retreats of
prayer and contemplation have something so congenial to the
mind of man, that, perhaps, there is scarcely one that does
not purpose to close his life in pious abstraction, with a few
associates serious as himself.”</p>

<p>“Such,” said Pekuah, “has often been my wish, and I have
heard the princess declare, that she could not willingly die
in a crowd.”</p>

<p>“The liberty of using harmless pleasures,” proceeded Imlac,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
“will not be disputed; but it is still to be examined what
pleasures are harmless. The evil of any pleasure that Nekayah
can image, is not in the act itself, but in its consequences.
Pleasure, in itself harmless, may become mischievous, by
endearing to us a state which we know to be transient and
probatory, and withdrawing our thoughts from that of which
every hour brings us nearer to the beginning, and of which no
length of time will bring us to the end. Mortification is not
virtuous in itself, nor has any other use, but that it disengages
us from the allurements of sense. In the state of future perfection,
to which we all aspire, there will be pleasure without
danger, and security without restraint.”</p>

<p>The princess was silent; and Rasselas, turning to the
astronomer, asked him, whether he could not delay her retreat,
by showing her something which she had not seen before.</p>

<p>“Your curiosity,” said the sage, “has been so general, and
your pursuit of knowledge so vigorous, that novelties are not
now very easily to be found; but what you can no longer
procure from the living may be given by the dead. Among
the wonders of this country are the Catacombs, or the ancient
repositories in which the bodies of the earliest generations
were lodged, and where, by the virtue of the gums which
embalmed them, they yet remain without corruption.”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said Rasselas, “what pleasure the sight of
the Catacombs can afford; but, since nothing else offered, I
am resolved to view them, and shall place this with many other
things, which I have done because I would do something.”</p>

<p>They hired a guard of horsemen, and the next day visited
the Catacombs. When they were about to descend into the
sepulchral caves, “Pekuah,” said the princess, “we are now
again invading the habitations of the dead; I know that you
will stay behind; let me find you safe when I return.” “No;
I will not be left,” answered Pekuah, “I will go down between
you and the prince.”</p>

<p>They then all descended, and roved with wonder through
the labyrinth of subterraneous passages, where the bodies were
laid in rows on either side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII<br /><br />
<span class="sub">IMLAC DISCOURSES ON THE NATURE OF THE SOUL</span></h3>

<p>“What reason,” said the prince, “can be given, why the
Egyptians should thus expensively preserve those carcasses,
which some nations consume with fire, others lay to mingle
with the earth, and all agree to remove from their sight as
soon as decent rites can be performed?”</p>

<p>“The original of ancient customs,” said Imlac, “is commonly
unknown, for the practice often continues when the cause has
ceased; and concerning superstitious ceremonies it is vain to
conjecture, for what reason did not dictate reason cannot
explain. I have long believed that the practice of embalming
arose only from tenderness to the remains of relations or
friends, and to this opinion I am more inclined, because it seems
impossible that this care should have been general: had all the
dead been embalmed, their repositories must in time have been
more spacious than the dwellings of the living. I suppose
only the rich or honourable were secured from corruption, and
the rest left to the course of nature.</p>

<p>“But it is commonly supposed, that the Egyptians believed
the soul to live as long as the body continued undissolved, and
therefore tried this method of eluding death.”</p>

<p>“Could the wise Egyptians,” said Nekayah, “think so grossly
of the soul? If the soul could once survive its separation,
what could it afterwards receive or suffer from the body?”</p>

<p>“The Egyptians would doubtless think erroneously,” said
the astronomer, “in the darkness of heathenism, and the
first dawn of philosophy. The nature of the soul is still disputed,
amidst all our opportunities of clearer knowledge: some yet say
that it may be material, who, nevertheless, believe it to be
immortal.”</p>

<p>“Some,” answered Imlac, “have indeed said that the soul
is material, but I can scarcely believe that any man has thought
it, who knew how to think; for all the conclusions of reason
enforce the immateriality of mind, and all the notices of sense
and investigations of science concur to prove the unconsciousness
of matter.</p>

<p>“It was never supposed that cogitation is inherent in matter,
or that every particle is a thinking being. Yet, if any part of
matter be devoid of thought, what part can we suppose to
think? Matter can differ from matter only in form, density,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
bulk, motion, and direction of motion: to which of these,
however varied or combined, can consciousness be annexed?
To be round or square, to be solid or fluid, to be great or little,
to be moved slowly or swiftly one way or another, are modes
of material existence, all equally alien from the nature of
cogitation. If matter be once without thought, it can only
be made to think by some new modification; but all the modifications
which it can admit are equally unconnected with
cogitative powers.”</p>

<p>“But the materialists,” said the astronomer, “urge that
matter may have qualities with which we are unacquainted.”</p>

<p>“He who will determine,” returned Imlac, “against that
which he knows, because there may be something which he
knows not,&mdash;he that can set hypothetical possibility against
acknowledged certainty,&mdash;is not to be admitted among reasonable
beings. All that we know of matter is, that matter is
inert, senseless, and lifeless; and if this conviction cannot
be opposed but by referring us to something that we know
not, we have all the evidence that human intellect can admit.
If that which is known may be overruled by that which is
unknown, no being, not omniscient, can arrive at certainty.”</p>

<p>“Yet let us not,” said the astronomer, “too arrogantly
limit the Creator’s power.”</p>

<p>“It is no limitation of omnipotence,” replied the poet, “to
suppose that one thing is not consistent with another, that
the same proposition cannot be at once true and false, that
the same number cannot be even and odd, that cogitation
cannot be conferred on that which is created incapable of
cogitation.”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said Nekayah, “any great use of this question.
Does that immateriality, which in my opinion you have
sufficiently proved, necessarily include eternal duration?”</p>

<p>“Of immateriality,” said Imlac, “our ideas are negative,
and therefore obscure. Immateriality seems to imply a natural
power of perpetual duration as a consequence of exemption
from all causes of decay; whatever perishes is destroyed by the
solution of its contexture, and separation of its parts; nor can
we conceive how that which has no parts, and therefore admits
no solution, can be naturally corrupted or impaired.”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said Rasselas, “how to conceive anything
without extension; what is extended must have parts, and
you allow that whatever has parts may be destroyed.”</p>

<p>“Consider your own conceptions,” replied Imlac, “and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
difficulty will be less. You will find substance without extension.
An ideal form is no less real than material bulk; yet an
ideal form has no extension. It is no less certain, when you
think on a pyramid, that your mind possesses the idea of a
pyramid, than that the pyramid itself is standing. What space
does the idea of a pyramid occupy more than the idea of a
grain of corn? or how can either idea suffer laceration? As is
the effect, such is the cause: as thought, such is the power that
thinks; a power impassive and indiscerptible.”</p>

<p>“But the Being,” said Nekayah, “whom I fear to name, the
Being which made the soul, can destroy it.”</p>

<p>“He surely can destroy it,” answered Imlac, “since, however
unperishable, it receives from a superior nature its power of
duration. That it will not perish by any inherent cause of
decay, or principle of corruption, may be shown by philosophy;
but philosophy can tell no more. That it will not be annihilated
by Him that made it, we must humbly learn from higher
authority.” The whole assembly stood a while silent and
collected. “Let us return,” said Rasselas, “from this scene
of mortality. How gloomy would be these mansions of the
dead to him who did not know that he should never die, that
what now acts shall continue its agency, and what now thinks
shall think on for ever. Those that lie here stretched before us,
the wise and the powerful of ancient times, warn us to remember
the shortness of our present state: they were, perhaps, snatched
away while they were busy like us in the choice of life.”</p>

<p>“To me,” said the princess, “the choice of life is become
less important; I hope hereafter to think only on the choice
of eternity.”</p>

<p>They then hastened out of the caverns, and under the
protection of their guard returned to Cairo.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIX<br /><br />
<span class="sub">THE CONCLUSION, IN WHICH NOTHING IS CONCLUDED</span></h3>

<p>It was now the time of the inundation of the Nile: a few days
after their visit to the Catacombs, the river began to rise.</p>

<p>They were confined to their house. The whole region being
under water gave them no invitation to any excursions, and
being well supplied with material for talk, they diverted themselves
with comparisons of the different forms of life which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
they had observed, and with various schemes of happiness
which each of them had formed.</p>

<p>Pekuah was never so much charmed with any place as the
convent of St. Anthony, where the Arab restored her to the
princess, and wished only to fill it with pious maidens, and to
be made prioress of the order; she was weary of expectation
and disgust, and would gladly be fixed in some unvariable
state.</p>

<p>The princess thought, that of all sublunary things knowledge
was the best: she desired first to learn all sciences, and then
proposed to found a college of learned women, in which she
would preside, that, by conversing with the old, and educating
the young, she might divide her time between the acquisition
and communication of wisdom, and raise up for the next age
models of prudence, and patterns of piety.</p>

<p>The prince desired a little kingdom, in which he might administer
justice in his own person, and see all the parts of government
with his own eyes; but he could never fix the limits of his
dominion, and was always adding to the number of his subjects.</p>

<p>Imlac and the astronomer were contented to be driven along
the stream of life, without directing their course to any
particular port.</p>

<p>Of these wishes that they had formed they well knew that
none could be obtained. They deliberated awhile what was
to be done, and resolved, when the inundation should cease,
to return to Abyssinia.</p>

<div class="bio">
<h3>HORACE WALPOLE</h3>

<p>Horace Walpole, the fourth son of Sir Robert Walpole, was born at
17 Arlington Street on 24 September, 1717. He spent the greater part of
his boyhood at his father’s house in Chelsea, a building that is now part
of the Hospital. At Eton, Walpole did not distinguish himself in any
way. After leaving Cambridge in 1737, his father appointed him Inspector
of Imports and Exports in the Customs House, and, in the following
year, Usher to the Exchequer. In 1739 he began the usual “grand tour”
on the Continent, where he developed a passion for antiquities. He
returned to England at the end of 1741. His father died in March 1745,
and in 1747 Walpole settled in the neighbourhood of Twickenham at
Strawberry Hill. The transforming of this house into “a little Gothic
castle” and museum was the chief occupation of the greater part of his
life. Here he erected a private printing press on which he printed many
of his own works as well as some poems of Gray. Although never really
interested in politics, in 1754 Walpole entered Parliament as member
for Castle Rising in Norfolk, vacating this seat three years later for that
of Lynn. About this time, too, he made an unsuccessful attempt to save
the unfortunate Admiral Byng. He went to Paris in 1765, where he
formed a friendship with Madame du Deffand which lasted until her death
in 1780. But from 1769 until his death, his life, apart from intermittent
literary work and adding to his museum, was comparatively uneventful.
In 1773, however, his comedy <i>Nature Will Prevail</i> was acted at the Haymarket
with considerable success. In 1791, on the death of his brother,
he acceded to the Earldom of Orford. He died at what was then
40 Berkeley Square on 2 March, 1797.</p>

<p>Among his books printed at Strawberry Hill are: <i>A Letter from Xo Ho,
a Chinese Philosopher at London, to his friend Lien Chi, at Peking</i>, 1757.
<i>A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England</i>, 2 vols., 1758.

<h3>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h3>

<p>The following work was found in the library of an ancient
Catholic family in the north of England. It was printed at
Naples, in the black letter, in the year 1529. How much
sooner it was written does not appear. The principal incidents
are such as were believed in the darkest ages of Christianity;
but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of
barbarism. The style is of the purest Italian. If the story was
written near the time when it is supposed to have happened,
it must have been between 1095, the era of the first crusade,
and 1243, the date of the last, or not long afterwards. There
is no other circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess
at the period in which the scene is laid; the names of the actors
are evidently fictitious, and probably disguised on purpose;
yet the Spanish names of the domestics seem to indicate, that
this work was not composed until the establishment of the
Arragonian kings in Naples had made Spanish appellations
familiar in that country. The beauty of the diction, and the
zeal of the author (moderated, however, by singular judgment),
concur to make me think that the date of the composition was
little antecedent to that of the impression. Letters were then
in the most flourishing state in Italy, and contributed to dispel
the empire of superstition, at that time so forcibly attacked by
the reformers. It is not unlikely that an artful priest might
endeavour to turn their own arms on the innovators; and might
avail himself of his abilities as an author to confirm the populace
in their ancient errors and superstitions. If this was his view,
he has certainly acted with signal address. Such a work as
the following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond
half the books of controversy that have been written from the
days of Luther to the present hour.</p>

<p>This solution of the author’s motives is, however, offered as
a mere conjecture. Whatever his views were, or whatever
effects the execution of them might have, his work can only
be laid before the public at present as a matter of entertainment.
Even as such some apology for it is necessary. Miracles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
visions, necromancies, dreams, and other preternatural events,
are exploded now even from romances. That was not the
case when our author wrote; much less when the story itself is
supposed to have happened. Belief in every kind of prodigy
was so established in those dark ages, that an author would not
be faithful to the manners of the times who should omit all
mention of them. He is not bound to believe them himself,
but he must represent his actors as believing them.</p>

<p>If this air of the miraculous is excused, the reader will find
nothing else unworthy of his perusal. Allow the possibility
of the facts, and all the actors comport themselves as persons
would do in their situation. There is no bombast, no similes,
flowers, digressions, or unnecessary descriptions. Everything
tends directly to the catastrophe. Never is the reader’s attention
relaxed. The rules of the drama are almost observed
throughout the conduct of the piece. The characters are well
drawn, and still better maintained. Terror, the author’s
principal engine, prevents the story from ever languishing; and
it is so often contrasted by pity, that the mind is kept up in a
constant vicissitude of interesting passions.</p>

<p>Some persons may, perhaps, think the characters of the
domestics too little serious for the general cast of the story;
but, besides their opposition to the principal personages, the
art of the author is very observable in his conduct of the
subalterns. They discover many passages essential to the
story, which could not be well brought to light but by their
<i>naïveté</i> and simplicity: in particular, the womanish terror and
foibles of Bianca, in the last chapter, conduce essentially towards
advancing the catastrophe.</p>

<p>It is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of
his adopted work. More impartial readers may not be so much
struck with the beauties of this piece as I was. Yet I am not
blind to my author’s defects. I could wish he had grounded
his plan on a more useful moral than this; that <i>the sins of the
fathers are visited on their children to the third and fourth generation</i>.
I doubt whether, in his time, any more than at present,
ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of so
remote a punishment. And yet this moral is weakened by that
less direct insinuation, that even such anathema may be diverted
by devotion to St. Nicholas. Here the interest of the monk
plainly gets the better of the judgment of the author. However,
with all its faults, I have no doubt but the English reader
will be pleased with a sight of this performance. The piety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that reigns throughout, the lessons of virtue that are inculcated,
and the rigid purity of the sentiments, exempt this work from
the censure to which romances are but too liable. Should it
meet with the success I hope for, I may be encouraged to reprint
the original Italian, though it will tend to depreciate my own
labour. Our language falls far short of the charms of the
Italian, both for variety and harmony. The latter is peculiarly
excellent for simple narrative. It is difficult in English <i>to relate</i>
without falling too low or rising too high; a fault obviously
occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure language in
common conversation. Every Italian or Frenchman, of any
rank, piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and
with choice. I cannot flatter myself with having done justice
to my author in this respect: his style is as elegant as his conduct
of the passions is masterly. It is pity that he did not apply his
talents to what they were evidently proper for&mdash;the theatre.</p>

<p>I will detain the reader no longer, but to make one short
remark. Though the machinery is invention, and the names
of the actors imaginary, I cannot but believe that the groundwork
of the story is founded on truth. The scene is undoubtedly
laid in some real castle. The author seems frequently, without
design, to describe particular parts. <i>The chamber</i>, says he, <i>on
the right hand; the door on the left hand; the distance from the
chapel to Conrad’s apartment</i>: these, and other passages, are
strong presumptions that the author had some certain building
in his eye. Curious persons, who have leisure to employ in
such researches, may possibly discover in the Italian writers
the foundation on which our author has built. If a catastrophe,
at all resembling that which he describes, is believed to have
given rise to this work, it will contribute to interest the reader,
and will make <span class="smcap">The Castle of Otranto</span> a still more moving
story.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h3>

<p>The favourable manner in which this little piece has been
received by the public calls upon the author to explain the
grounds on which he composed it. But before he opens those
motives, it is fit that he should ask pardon of his readers for
having offered his work to them under the borrowed personage
of a translator. As diffidence of his own abilities, and the
novelty of the attempt, were the sole inducements to assume
that disguise, he flatters himself he shall appear excusable. He
resigned his performance to the impartial judgment of the
public; determined to let it perish in obscurity, if disapproved;
nor meaning to avow such a trifle, unless better judges should
pronounce that he might own it without a blush.</p>

<p>It was an attempt to blend the two kinds of romance: the
ancient and the modern. In the former, all was imagination
and improbability; in the latter, nature is always intended to
be, and sometimes has been, copied with success. Invention
has not been wanting; but the great resources of fancy have
been dammed up, by a strict adherence to common life. But
if in the latter species nature has cramped imagination, she did
but take her revenge, having been totally excluded from old
romances. The actions, sentiments, conversations, of the heroes
and heroines of ancient days, were as unnatural as the machines
employed to put them in motion.</p>

<p>The author of the following pages thought it possible to
reconcile the two kinds. Desirous of leaving the powers of fancy
at liberty to expatiate through the boundless realms of invention,
and thence of creating more interesting situations, he
wished to conduct the mortal agents in his drama according to
the rules of probability; in short, to make them think, speak,
and act, as it might be supposed mere men and women would
do in extraordinary positions. He had observed, that in all
inspired writings, the personages under the dispensation of
miracles, and witnesses to the most stupendous phenomena,
never lose sight of their human character; whereas, in the
productions of romantic story, an improbable event never fails<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to be attended by an absurd dialogue. The actors seem to
lose their senses, the moment the laws of nature have lost
their tone. As the public have applauded the attempt, the
author must not say he was entirely unequal to the task he had
undertaken; yet if the new route he has struck out shall have
paved a road for men of brighter talents, he shall own with
pleasure and modesty, that he was sensible the plan was capable
of receiving greater embellishments than his imagination or
conduct of the passions could bestow on it.</p>

<p>With regard to the deportment of the domestics, on which I
have touched in the former preface, I will beg leave to add a
few words. The simplicity of their behaviour, almost tending
to excite smiles, which at first seems not consonant to the serious
cast of the work, appeared to me not only not improper, but
was marked designedly in that manner. My rule was nature.
However grave, important, or even melancholy, the sensations
of princes and heroes may be, they do not stamp the same
affections on their domestics; at least the latter do not, or
should not be made to express their passions in the same dignified
tone. In my humble opinion, the contrast between the
sublime of the one and the <i>naïveté</i> of the other, sets the pathetic
of the former in a stronger light. The very impatience which
a reader feels while delayed by the coarse pleasantries of vulgar
actors from arriving at the knowledge of the important catastrophe
he expects, perhaps heightens, certainly proves, that
he has been artfully interested in the depending event. But I
had higher authority than my own opinion for this conduct.
That great master of nature, Shakespeare, was the model I
copied. Let me ask if his tragedies of <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Julius
Cæsar</i> would not lose a considerable share of their spirit and
wonderful beauties, if the humour of the grave-diggers, the
fooleries of Polonius, and the clumsy jests of the Roman citizens,
were omitted, or vested in heroics? Is not the eloquence of
Antony, the nobler and affectingly unaffected oration of Brutus,
artificially exalted by the rude outbursts of nature from the
mouths of their auditors? These touches remind one of the
Grecian sculptor, who, to convey the idea of a Colossus within
the dimensions of a seal, inserted a little boy measuring his
thumb.</p>

<p>No, says Voltaire, in his edition of Corneille, this mixture of
buffoonery and solemnity is intolerable.&mdash;Voltaire is a genius&mdash;but
not of Shakespeare’s magnitude. Without recurring to
disputable authority, I appeal from Voltaire to himself. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
shall not avail myself of his former encomiums on our mighty
poet, though the French critic has twice translated the same
speech in <i>Hamlet</i>, some years ago in admiration, latterly in
derision; and I am sorry to find that his judgment grows weaker
when it ought to be farther matured. But I shall make use of
his own words, delivered on the general topic of the theatre,
when he was neither thinking to recommend or decry Shakespeare’s
practice; consequently at a moment when Voltaire was
impartial. In the preface to his <i>Enfant Prodigue</i>, that exquisite
piece, of which I declare my admiration, and which, should I
live twenty years longer, I trust I shall never attempt to ridicule,
he has these words, speaking of comedy (but equally applicable
to tragedy, if tragedy is, as surely it ought to be, a picture of
human life; nor can I conceive why occasional pleasantry ought
more to be banished from the tragic scene, than pathetic seriousness
from the comic): “<i>On y voit un melange de serieux et de
plaisanterie, de comique et de touchant</i>; souvent meme une
seule avanture <i>produit tous ces contrastes. Rien n’est si commun
qu’une maison dans laquelle</i> un pere gronde, une fille occupée
de sa passion pleure; <i>le fils se moque des deux, et quelques parens
prennent part differemment à la scene, etc. Nous n’inferons pas
de là que toute comedie doive avoir des scenes de bouffonerie et des
scenes attendrissantes: il y a beaucoup de tres bonnes pièces où
il ne regne que de la gayeté; d’autres toutes serieuses; d’autres
melangées: d’autres où l’attendrissement va jusqu’aux larmes</i>:
il ne faut donner l’exclusion à aucun genre: <i>et si l’on me demandoit
quel genre est le meilleur, je repondrois, celui qui est le mieux
traité</i>.” Surely if a comedy may be <i>toute serieuse</i>, tragedy
may now and then, soberly, be indulged in a smile. Who shall
proscribe it? shall the critic, who, in self-defence, declares that
<i>no kind</i> ought to be excluded from comedy, give laws to
Shakespeare?</p>

<p>I am aware that the preface from whence I have quoted these
passages does not stand in Monsieur de Voltaire’s name, but
in that of his editor; yet who doubts that the editor and author
were the same person? or where is the editor who has so happily
possessed himself of his author’s style and brilliant ease of argument?
These passages were indubitably the genuine sentiments
of that great writer. In his epistle to Maffei, prefixed to
his <i>Merope</i>, he delivers almost the same opinion, though I
doubt with a little irony. I will repeat his words, and then
give my reason for quoting them. After translating a passage
in Maffei’s <i>Merope</i>, Monsieur de Voltaire adds, “<i>Tous ces traits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sont naïfs: tout y est convenable à ceux que vous introduisez sur
la scene</i>, et aux mœurs que vous leur donnez. <i>Ces familiarités
naturelles eussent été, à ce que je crois, bien reçues dans Athenes;
mais Paris et notre parterre veulent une autre espece de simplicité.</i>”
I doubt, I say, whether there is not a grain of sneer in this
and other passages of that epistle; yet the force of truth is not
damaged by being tinged with ridicule. Maffei was to represent
a Grecian story: surely the Athenians were as competent judges
of Grecian manners and of the propriety of introducing them,
as the parterre of Paris. On the contrary, says Voltaire (and I
cannot but admire his reasoning), there were but ten thousand
citizens at Athens, and Paris has near eight hundred thousand
inhabitants, among whom one may reckon thirty thousand
judges of dramatic works.&mdash;Indeed! but, allowing so numerous
a tribunal, I believe this is the only instance in which it was
ever pretended, that thirty thousand persons, living near two
thousand years after the era in question, were, upon the mere
face of the poll, declared better judges than the Grecians themselves
of what ought to be the manners of a tragedy written
on a Grecian story.</p>

<p>I will not enter into a discussion of the <i>espece de simplicité</i>,
which the parterre of Paris demands, nor of the shackles with
which <i>the thirty thousand judges</i> have cramped their poetry, the
chief merit of which, as I gather from repeated passages in <i>The
New Commentary on Corneille</i>, consists in vaulting in spite of
those fetters; a merit which, if true, would reduce poetry, from
the lofty effort of imagination, to a puerile and most contemptible
labour&mdash;<i>difficiles nugæ</i> with a witness! I cannot, however,
help mentioning a couplet, which, to my English ears, always
sounded as the flattest and most trifling instance of circumstantial
propriety: but which Voltaire, who has dealt so severely
with nine parts in ten of Corneille’s works, has singled out to
defend in Racine:</p>

<p>Unhappy Shakespeare! hadst thou made Rosencrantz inform

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>Manfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter:
the latter, a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called
Matilda. Conrad, the son, was three years younger, a homely
youth, sickly, and of no promising disposition; yet he was the
darling of his father, who never showed any symptoms of
affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for
his son with the Marquis of Vicenza’s daughter, Isabella; and
she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands
of Manfred, that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as
Conrad’s infirm state of health would permit. Manfred’s
impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family
and neighbours. The former, indeed, apprehending the severity
of their prince’s disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises
on this precipitation. Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady,
did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying
their only son so early, considering his great youth, and greater
infirmities; but she never received any other answer than
reflections on her own sterility, who had given him but one
heir. His tenants and subjects were less cautious in their
discourses: they attributed this hasty wedding to the prince’s
dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was
said to have pronounced, that <i>the castle and lordship of Otranto
should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner
should be grown too large to inhabit it</i>. It was difficult to make
any sense of this prophecy; and still less easy to conceive what
it had to do with the marriage in question. Yet these mysteries,
or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere the less
to their opinion.</p>

<p>Young Conrad’s birthday was fixed for his espousals. The
company was assembled in the chapel of the castle, and everything
ready for beginning the divine office, when Conrad himself
was missing. Manfred, impatient of the least delay, and
who had not observed his son retire, dispatched one of his
attendants to summon the young prince. The servant, who had
not stayed long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad’s
apartment, came running back breathless, in a frantic manner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
his eyes staring, and foaming at the mouth. He said nothing,
but pointed to the court. The company were struck with
terror and amazement. The Princess Hippolita, without knowing
what was the matter, but anxious for her son, swooned
away. Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination
of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic,
asked imperiously what was the matter? The fellow made no
answer, but continued pointing towards the court-yard; and,
at last, after repeated questions put to him, cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh! the helmet! the helmet!”</p>

<p>In the mean time, some of the company had run into the
court, from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks,
horror, and surprise. Manfred, who began to be alarmed at
not seeing his son, went himself to get information of what
occasioned this strange confusion. Matilda remained endeavouring
to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for the same
purpose, and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom,
for whom, in truth, she had conceived little affection.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck Manfred’s eyes was a group of
his servants endeavouring to raise something that appeared to
him a mountain of sable plumes. He gazed without believing
his sight. “What are ye doing?” cried Manfred, wrathfully.
“Where is my son?”</p>

<p>A volley of voices replied, “Oh! my lord! the prince! the
prince! the helmet! the helmet!”</p>

<p>Shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew
not what, he advanced hastily&mdash;but, what a sight for a father’s
eyes!&mdash;he beheld his child dashed to pieces, and almost buried
under an enormous helmet, a hundred times more large than
any casque ever made for human being, and shaded with a
proportionable quantity of black feathers.</p>

<p>The horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how
this misfortune had happened, and, above all, the tremendous
phenomenon before him, took away the prince’s speech. Yet
his silence lasted longer than even grief could occasion. He
fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain to believe a vision;
and seemed less attentive to his loss, than buried in meditation
on the stupendous object that had occasioned it. He touched,
he examined, the fatal casque; nor could even the bleeding,
mangled remains of the young prince divert the eyes of Manfred
from the portent before him. All who had known his partial
fondness for young Conrad were as much surprised at their
prince’s insensibility, as thunderstruck themselves at the miracle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of the helmet. They conveyed the disfigured corpse into the
hall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred. As
little was he attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel;
on the contrary, without mentioning the unhappy princesses,
his wife and daughter, the first sounds that dropped from
Manfred’s lips were, “Take care of the Lady Isabella.”</p>

<p>The domestics, without observing the singularity of this
direction, were guided by their affection to their mistress to
consider it as peculiarly addressed to her situation, and flew
to her assistance. They conveyed her to her chamber more
dead than alive, and indifferent to all the strange circumstances
she heard, except the death of her son. Matilda, who doted on
her mother, smothered her own grief and amazement, and
thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted
parent. Isabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a
daughter, and who returned that tenderness with equal duty
and affection, was scarce less assiduous about the princess; at
the same time endeavouring to partake and lessen the weight
of sorrow which she saw Matilda strove to suppress, for whom
she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship. Yet
her own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts.
She felt no concern for the death of young Conrad, except
commiseration; and she was not sorry to be delivered from a
marriage which had promised her little felicity, either from her
destined bridegroom, or from the severe temper of Manfred,
who, though he had distinguished her by great indulgence, had
impressed her mind with terror, from his causeless rigour to
such amiable princesses as Hippolita and Matilda.</p>

<p>While the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her
bed, Manfred remained in the court, gazing on the ominous
casque, and regardless of the crowd which the strangeness of
the event had now assembled around him. The few words he
articulated tended solely to inquiries, whether any man knew
from whence it could have come? Nobody could give him the
least information. However, as it seemed to be the sole object
of his curiosity, it soon became so to the rest of the spectators,
whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable, as the
catastrophe itself was unprecedented. In the midst of their
senseless guesses, a young peasant, whom rumour had drawn
thither from a neighbouring village, observed, that the miraculous
helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble
of Alfonso the Good, one of their former princes, in the church
of St. Nicholas.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
“Villain! what sayest thou?” cried Manfred, starting from
his trance in a tempest of rage, and seizing the young man
by the collar; “how darest thou utter such treason? thy life
shall pay for it.”</p>

<p>The spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the
prince’s fury as all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to
unravel this new circumstance. The young peasant himself
was still more astonished, not conceiving how he had offended
the prince; yet, recollecting himself, with a mixture of grace
and humility, he disengaged himself from Manfred’s gripe, and
then, with an obeisance which discovered more jealousy of
innocence than dismay, he asked, with respect, of what he
was guilty? Manfred, more enraged at the vigour, however
decently exerted, with which the young man had shaken off his
hold, than appeased by his submission, ordered his attendants
to seize him, and, if he had not been withheld by his friends,
whom he had invited to the nuptials, would have poniarded
the peasant in their arms.</p>

<p>During this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had
run to the great church, which stood near the castle, and came
back open-mouthed, declaring that the helmet was missing
from Alfonso’s statue. Manfred, at this news, grew perfectly
frantic; and, as if he sought a subject on which to vent the
tempest within him, he rushed again on the young peasant,
crying, “Villain! monster! sorcerer! ’tis thou hast done this!
’tis thou hast slain my son!”</p>

<p>The mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their
capacities, on whom they might discharge their bewildered
reasonings, caught the words from the mouth of their lord, and
re-echoed, “Ay, ay; ’tis he, ’tis he! he has stolen the helmet
from good Alfonso’s tomb, and dashed out the brains of our
young prince with it,” never reflecting how enormous the disproportion
was between the marble helmet that had been in the
church, and that of steel before their eyes; nor how impossible
it was for a youth, seemingly not twenty, to wield a piece of
armour of so prodigious a weight.</p>

<p>The folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to himself:
yet, whether provoked at the peasant having observed the
resemblance between the two helmets, and thereby led to the
farther discovery of the absence of that in the church, or wishing
to bury any fresh rumour under so impertinent a supposition,
he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a
necromancer; and that till the Church could take cognizance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the affair, he would have the magician, whom they had thus
detected, kept prisoner under the helmet itself, which he ordered
his attendants to raise, and place the young man under it;
declaring he should be kept there without food, with which his
own infernal art might furnish him.</p>

<p>It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous
sentence: in vain did Manfred’s friends endeavour to
divert him from this savage and ill-grounded resolution. The
generality were charmed with their lord’s decision, which to
their apprehensions carried great appearance of justice, as the
magician was to be punished by the very instrument with
which he had offended; nor were they struck with the least
compunction at the probability of the youth being starved,
for they firmly believed that, by his diabolical skill, he could
easily supply himself with nutriment.</p>

<p>Manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed; and
appointing a guard, with strict orders to prevent any food
being conveyed to the prisoner, he dismissed his friends and
attendants, and retired to his own chamber, after locking the
gates of the castle, in which he suffered none but his domestics
to remain.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the care and zeal of the young ladies had
brought the Princess Hippolita to herself, who, amidst the
transports of her own sorrow, frequently demanded news of
her lord, would have dismissed her attendants to watch over
him, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave her, and visit and
comfort her father. Matilda, who wanted not affectionate duty
to Manfred, though she trembled at his austerity, obeyed the
orders of Hippolita, whom she tenderly recommended to Isabella;
and inquiring of the domestics of her father, was informed that
he was retired to his chamber, and had commanded that nobody
should have admittance to him. Concluding that he was
immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother, and fearing
to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child, she
hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction: yet
solicitude for him, backed by the commands of her mother,
encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had given;
a fault she had never been guilty of before. The gentle timidity
of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his door.
She heard him traverse his chamber backwards and forwards
with disordered steps; a mood which increased her apprehensions.
She was however just going to beg admittance, when
Manfred suddenly opened the door; and as it was now twilight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
concurring with the disorder of his mind, he did not distinguish
the person, but asked angrily, who it was? Matilda replied,
trembling, “My dearest father, it is I, your daughter.”</p>

<p>Manfred, stepping back hastily, cried, “Begone, I do not want
a daughter”; and, flinging back abruptly, clapped the door
against the terrified Matilda.</p>

<p>She was too well acquainted with her father’s impetuosity to
venture a second intrusion. When she had a little recovered
the shock of so bitter a reception, she wiped away her tears,
to prevent the additional stab that the knowledge of it would
give to Hippolita, who questioned her in the most anxious terms
on the health of Manfred, and how he bore his loss. Matilda
assured her he was well, and supported his misfortune with
manly fortitude.</p>

<p>“But will he not let me see him?” said Hippolita, mournfully;
“will he not permit me to blend my tears with his, and
shed a mother’s sorrows in the bosom of her lord? Or do you
deceive me, Matilda? I know how Manfred doted on his son:
is not the stroke too heavy for him? has he not sunk under it?
You do not answer me:&mdash;alas! I dread the worst!&mdash;raise me,
my maidens; I will, I will see my lord. Bear me to him instantly.
He is dearer to me even than my children.”</p>

<p>Matilda made signs to Isabella to prevent Hippolita’s rising;
and both those lovely young women were using their gentle
violence to stop and calm the princess, when a servant, on the
part of Manfred, arrived, and told Isabella that his lord demanded
to speak with her.</p>

<p>“With me!” cried Isabella.</p>

<p>“Go,” said Hippolita, relieved by a message from her lord:
“Manfred cannot support the sight of his own family. He
thinks you less disordered than we are, and dreads the shock
of my grief. Console him, dear Isabella, and tell him I will
smother my own anguish rather than add to his.”</p>

<p>As it was now evening, the servant who conducted Isabella
bore a torch before her. When they came to Manfred, who
was walking impatiently about the gallery, he started, and
said hastily:</p>

<p>“Take away that light, and begone.” Then shutting the
door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench against the
wall, and bade Isabella sit by him. She obeyed trembling.</p>

<p>“I sent for you, lady,” said he, and then stopped, under
great appearance of confusion.</p>

<p>“My lord!”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
“Yes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment,” resumed
he: “dry your tears, young lady:&mdash;you have lost your bridegroom.
Yes, cruel fate! and I have lost the hopes of my race!
but Conrad was not worthy of your beauty.”</p>

<p>“How! my lord,” said Isabella; “sure you do not suspect
me of not feeling the concern I ought! my duty and affection
would have always&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Think no more of him,” interrupted Manfred: “he was a
sickly, puny child; and Heaven has perhaps taken him away,
that I might not trust the honours of my house on so frail a
foundation. The line of Manfred calls for numerous supports.
My foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes of my prudence&mdash;but
it is better as it is. I hope, in a few years, to have reason
to rejoice at the death of Conrad.”</p>

<p>Words cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella. At first
she apprehended that grief had disordered Manfred’s understanding.
Her next thought suggested that this strange discourse
was designed to ensnare her: she feared that Manfred
had perceived her indifference for his son; and in consequence
of that idea she replied:</p>

<p>“Good my lord, do not doubt my tenderness: my heart would
have accompanied my hand. Conrad would have engrossed
all my care; and wherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always
cherish his memory, and regard your highness and the virtuous
Hippolita as my parents.”</p>

<p>“Curse on Hippolita!” cried Manfred: “forget her from this
moment, as I do. In short, lady, you have missed a husband
undeserving of your charms: they shall now be better disposed
of. Instead of a sickly boy, you shall have a husband in the
prime of his age, who will know how to value your beauties,
and who may expect a numerous offspring.”</p>

<p>“Alas! my lord,” said Isabella, “my mind is too sadly
engrossed by the recent catastrophe in your family to think
of another marriage. If ever my father returns, and it shall
be his pleasure, I shall obey, as I did when I consented to
give my hand to your son; but, until his return, permit me to
remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the melancholy
hours in assuaging yours, Hippolita’s, and the fair Matilda’s
affliction.”</p>

<p>“I desired you once before,” said Manfred, angrily, “not to
name that woman: from this hour she must be a stranger to
you, as she must be to me:&mdash;in short, Isabella, since I cannot
give you my son, I offer you myself.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
“Heavens!” cried Isabella, waking from her delusion, “what
do I hear? You, my lord! You! my father-in-law, the father
of Conrad! the husband of the virtuous and tender Hippolita!”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said Manfred imperiously, “Hippolita is no
longer my wife; I divorce her from this hour. Too long has
she cursed me by her unfruitfulness. My fate depends on
having sons, and this night I trust will give a new date to my
hopes.”</p>

<p>At those words he seized the cold hand of Isabella, who was
half dead with fright and horror. She shrieked and started
from him. Manfred rose to pursue her, when the moon, which
was now up and gleamed in at the opposite casement, presented
to his sight the plumes of the fatal helmet, which rose to the
height of the windows, waving backwards and forwards in a
tempestuous manner, and accompanied with a hollow and
rustling sound. Isabella, who gathered courage from her
situation, and who dreaded nothing so much as Manfred’s
pursuit of his declaration, cried:</p>

<p>“Look, my lord! see, Heaven itself declares against your
impious intentions!”</p>

<p>“Heaven nor hell shall impede my designs,” said Manfred,
advancing again to seize the princess. At that instant the
portrait of his grandfather, which hung over the bench where
they had been sitting, uttered a deep sigh, and heaved its breast.
Isabella, whose back was turned to the picture, saw not the
motion, nor whence the sound came but started, and said:</p>

<p>“Hark, my lord! what sound was that?” and at the same
time made towards the door. Manfred, distracted between the
flight of Isabella, who had now reached the stairs, and yet
unable to keep his eyes from the picture, which began to move,
had, however, advanced some steps after her, still looking
backwards on the portrait, when he saw it quit its panel, and
descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air.</p>

<p>“Do I dream?” cried Manfred, returning; “or are the devils
themselves in league against me? Speak, infernal spectre! or,
if thou art my grandsire, why dost thou, too, conspire against
thy wretched descendant, who too dearly pays for&mdash;&mdash;” Ere
he could finish the sentence, the vision sighed again, and made
a sign to Manfred to follow him.</p>

<p>“Lead on!” cried Manfred: “I will follow thee to the gulf of
perdition.” The spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to
the end of the gallery, and turned into a chamber on the right
hand. Manfred accompanied him at a little distance, full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
anxiety and horror, but resolved. As he would have entered
the chamber, the door was clapped to with violence by an
invisible hand. The prince, collecting courage from this delay,
would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot, but found
that it resisted his utmost efforts.</p>

<p>“Since hell will not satisfy my curiosity,” said Manfred, “I
will use the human means in my power for preserving my race;
Isabella shall not escape me.”</p>

<p>That lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the
moment she had quitted Manfred, continued her flight to the
bottom of the principal staircase. There she stopped, not
knowing whither to direct her steps, nor how to escape from
the impetuosity of the prince. The gates of the castle she
knew were locked, and guards placed in the court. Should
she, as her heart prompted her, go and prepare Hippolita for
the cruel destiny that awaited her, she did not doubt but
Manfred would seek her there, and that his violence would
incite him to double the injury he meditated, without leaving
room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his passions. Delay
might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he had
conceived, or produce some circumstance in her favour, if she
could, for that night at least, avoid his odious purpose. Yet
where conceal herself? how avoid the pursuit he would infallibly
make throughout the castle? As these thoughts passed rapidly
through her mind, she recollected a subterraneous passage which
led from the vaults of the castle to the church of St. Nicholas.
Could she reach the altar before she was overtaken, she knew
even Manfred’s violence would not dare to profane the sacredness
of the place; and she determined, if no other means of
deliverance offered, to shut herself up for ever among the holy
virgins, whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral. In
this resolution, she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of
the staircase, and hurried towards the secret passage.</p>

<p>The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate
cloisters; and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to
find the door that opened into the cavern. An awful silence
reigned throughout those subterraneous regions, except now and
then some blasts of wind that shook the doors she had passed,
and which, grating on the rusty hinges, were re-echoed through
that long labyrinth of darkness. Every murmur struck her
with new terror;&mdash;yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful
voice of Manfred urging his domestics to pursue her. She trod
as softly as impatience would give her leave,&mdash;yet frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
stopped, and listened to hear if she was followed. In one of
those moments she thought she heard a sigh. She shuddered,
and recoiled a few paces. In a moment she thought she heard
the step of some person. Her blood curdled: she concluded it
was Manfred. Every suggestion that horror could inspire
rushed into her mind. She condemned her rash flight, which
had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries were
not likely to draw anybody to her assistance. Yet the sound
seemed not to come from behind: if Manfred knew where she
was, he must have followed her: she was still in one of the
cloisters, and the steps she had heard were too distinct to
proceed from the way she had come. Cheered with this reflection,
and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the prince,
she was going to advance, when a door that stood ajar, at some
distance to the left, was opened gently; but ere her lamp, which
she held up, could discover who opened it, the person retreated
precipitately on seeing the light.</p>

<p>Isabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay,
hesitated whether she should proceed. Her dread of Manfred
soon outweighed every other terror. The very circumstance of
the person avoiding her, gave her a sort of courage. It could
only be, she thought, some domestic belonging to the castle.
Her gentleness had never raised her an enemy, and conscious
innocence made her hope that, unless sent by the prince’s order
to seek her, his servants would rather assist than prevent her
flight. Fortifying herself with these reflections, and believing,
by what she could observe, that she was near the mouth of the
subterraneous cavern, she approached the door that had been
opened; but a sudden gust of wind, that met her at the door,
extinguished her lamp, and left her in total darkness.</p>

<p>Words cannot paint the horror of the princess’s situation.
Alone, in so dismal a place, her mind impressed with all the
terrible events of the day, hopeless of escaping, expecting every
moment the arrival of Manfred, and far from tranquil on
knowing she was within reach of somebody, she knew not whom,
who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts; all these
thoughts crowded on her distracted mind, and she was ready
to sink under her apprehensions. She addressed herself to
every saint in heaven, and inwardly implored their assistance.
For a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair.
At last, as softly as was possible, she felt for the door, and
having found it, entered trembling into the vault from whence
she had heard the sigh and steps. It gave her a kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine
gleam from the roof of the vault, which seemed to be
fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment of earth or building,
she could not distinguish which, that appeared to have been
crushed inwards. She advanced eagerly towards this chasm,
when she discerned a human form standing close against the wall.</p>

<p>She shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed Conrad.
The figure, advancing, said in a submissive voice, “Be not
alarmed, lady, I will not injure you.”</p>

<p>Isabella, a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice
of the stranger, and recollecting that this must be the person
who had opened the door, recovered her spirits enough to
reply, “Sir, whoever you are, take pity on a wretched princess,
standing on the brink of destruction: assist me to escape from
this fatal castle, or, in a few moments, I may be made miserable
for ever.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the stranger, “what can I do to assist you?
I will die in your defence; but I am unacquainted with the
castle, and want&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Isabella, hastily interrupting him, “help me
but to find a trap-door that must be hereabout, and it is the
greatest service you can do me, for I have not a minute to lose.”
Saying these words, she felt about on the pavement, and directed
the stranger to search likewise, for a smooth piece of brass
enclosed in one of the stones. “That,” said she, “is the lock
which opens with a spring, of which I know the secret. If we
can find that, I may escape; if not, alas! courteous stranger,
I fear I shall have involved you in my misfortunes. Manfred
will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight, and you will
fall a victim to his resentment.”</p>

<p>“I value not my life,” said the stranger; “and it will be some
comfort to lose it, in trying to deliver you from his tyranny.”</p>

<p>“Generous youth!” said Isabella, “how shall I ever
requite&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, a ray of moonshine, streaming
through a cranny of the ruin above, shone directly on the lock
they sought.&mdash;“Oh! transport!” said Isabella, “here is the
trap-door”; and, taking out the key, she touched the spring,
which, starting aside, discovered an iron ring. “Lift up the
door,” said the princess. The stranger obeyed; and beneath
appeared some stone steps descending into a vault totally dark.
“We must go down here,” said Isabella: “follow me; dark and
dismal as it is, we cannot miss our way; it leads directly to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
church of St. Nicholas&mdash;but, perhaps,” added the princess,
modestly, “you have no reason to leave the castle, nor have I
farther occasion for your service; in a few minutes I shall be
safe from Manfred’s rage&mdash;only let me know to whom I am so
much obliged.”</p>

<p>“I will never quit you,” said the stranger eagerly, “until
I have placed you in safety&mdash;nor think me, princess, more
generous than I am; though you are my principal care&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices
that seemed approaching, and they soon distinguished these
words: “Talk not to me of necromancers; I tell you she must
be in the castle; I will find her in spite of enchantment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, heavens!” cried Isabella, “it is the voice of Manfred;
make haste, or we are ruined! and shut the trap-door after
you.” Saying this, she descended the steps precipitately; and
as the stranger hastened to follow her, he let the door slip out
of his hands: it fell, and the spring closed over it. He tried in
vain to open it, not having observed Isabella’s method of
touching the spring; nor had he many moments to make an
essay. The noise of the falling door had been heard by Manfred,
who, directed by the sound, hastened thither, attended by his
servants with torches.</p>

<p>“It must be Isabella,” cried Manfred, before he entered
the vault: “she is escaping by the subterraneous passage, but
she cannot have got far.” What was the astonishment of the
prince, when, instead of Isabella, the light of the torches discovered
to him the young peasant, whom he thought confined
under the fatal helmet. “Traitor!” said Manfred, “how camest
thou here? I thought thee in durance above in the court.”</p>

<p>“I am no traitor,” replied the young man boldly, “nor am
I answerable for your thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Presumptuous villain!” cried Manfred, “dost thou provoke
my wrath? Tell me; how hast thou escaped from above?
Thou hast corrupted thy guards, and their lives shall answer it.”</p>

<p>“My poverty,” said the peasant calmly, “will disculpate
them: though the ministers of a tyrant’s wrath, to thee they
are faithful, and but too willing to execute the orders which
you unjustly imposed upon them.”</p>

<p>“Art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance?” said the
prince; “but tortures shall force the truth from thee. Tell me;
I will know thy accomplices.”</p>

<p>“There was my accomplice!” said the youth, smiling and
pointing to the roof.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Manfred ordered the torches to be held up, and perceived
that one of the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced
its way through the pavement of the court, as his servants
had let it fall over the peasant, and had broken through into
the vault, leaving a gap through which the peasant had pressed
himself some minutes before he was found by Isabella. “Was
that the way by which thou didst descend?” said Manfred.</p>

<p>“It was,” said the youth.</p>

<p>“But what noise was that,” said Manfred, “which I heard,
as I entered the cloister?”</p>

<p>“A door clapped,” said the peasant; “I heard it as well
as you.”</p>

<p>“What door?” said Manfred hastily.</p>

<p>“I am not acquainted with your castle,” said the peasant:
“this is the first time I ever entered it; and this vault the only
part of it within which I ever was.”</p>

<p>“But I tell thee,” said Manfred, wishing to find out if the
youth had discovered the trap-door, “it was this way I heard
the noise; my servants heard it too.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” interrupted one of them officiously, “to be sure
it was the trap-door, and he was going to make his escape.”</p>

<p>“Peace! blockhead,” said the prince angrily; “if he was
going to escape, how should he come on this side? I will
know from his own mouth what noise it was I heard. Tell me
truly, thy life depends on thy veracity.”</p>

<p>“My veracity is dearer to me than my life,” said the peasant;
“nor would I purchase the one by forfeiting the other.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, young philosopher!” said Manfred, contemptuously;
“tell me, then, what was that noise I heard?”</p>

<p>“Ask me, what I can answer,” said he, “and put me to death
instantly, if I tell you a lie.”</p>

<p>Manfred, growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference
of the youth, cried, “Well, then, thou man of truth!
answer; was it the fall of the trap-door that I heard?”</p>

<p>“It was,” said the youth.</p>

<p>“It was!” said the prince; “and how didst thou come to know
there was a trap-door here?”</p>

<p>“I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine,” replied he.</p>

<p>“But what told thee it was a lock?” said Manfred; “how
didst thou discover the secret of opening it?”</p>

<p>“Providence, that delivered me from the helmet, was able
to direct me to the spring of a lock,” said he.</p>

<p>“Providence should have gone a little farther, and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
placed thee out of the reach of my resentment,” said Manfred:
“when Providence had taught thee to open the lock, it
abandoned thee for a fool, who did not know how to make use
of its favours. Why didst thou not pursue the path pointed
out for thy escape? Why didst thou shut the trap-door before
thou hadst descended the steps?”</p>

<p>“I might ask you, my lord,” said the peasant, “how I,
totally unacquainted with your castle, was to know that those
steps led to any outlet? but I scorn to evade your questions.
Wherever those steps led to, perhaps, I should have explored
the way. I could not be in a worse situation than I was. But
the truth is, I let the trap-door fall: your immediate arrival
followed. I had given the alarm&mdash;what imported it to me
whether I was seized a minute sooner or a minute later?”</p>

<p>“Thou art a resolute villain for thy years,” said Manfred;
“yet, on reflection, I suspect thou dost but trifle with me:
thou hast not yet told me how thou didst open the lock.”</p>

<p>“That I will show you, my lord,” said the peasant; and,
taking up a fragment of stone that had fallen from above, he
laid himself on the trap-door, and began to beat on the piece
of brass that covered it; meaning to gain time for the escape of
the princess. This presence of mind, joined to the frankness
of the youth, staggered Manfred. He even felt a disposition
towards pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime. Manfred
was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in cruelty
unprovoked. The circumstances of his fortune had given an
asperity to his temper, which was naturally humane; and his
virtues were always ready to operate, when his passions did
not obscure his reason.</p>

<p>While the prince was in this suspense, a confused noise of
voices echoed through the distant vaults. As the sound
approached, he distinguished the clamours of some of his
domestics, whom he had dispersed through the castle in search
of Isabella, calling out, “Where is my lord? where is the prince?”</p>

<p>“Here I am,” said Manfred, as they came nearer; “have
you found the princess?”</p>

<p>The first that arrived replied, “Oh, my lord, I am glad we
have found you.”</p>

<p>“Found me!” said Manfred; “have you found the princess?”</p>

<p>“We thought we had, my lord,” said the fellow, looking
terrified; “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But what?” cried the prince; “has she escaped?”</p>

<p>“Jaquez and I, my lord&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
“Yes, I and Diego,” interrupted the second, who came up
in still greater consternation.</p>

<p>“Speak one of you at a time,” said Manfred; “I ask you,
where is the princess?”</p>

<p>“We do not know,” said they both together; “but we are
frightened out of our wits.”</p>

<p>“So I think, blockheads,” said Manfred; “what is it has
scared you thus?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord,” said Jaquez, “Diego has seen such a sight!
your highness would not believe your eyes.”</p>

<p>“What new absurdity is this?” cried Manfred; “give me a
direct answer, or by Heaven&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, my lord, if it please your highness to hear me,” said
the poor fellow, “Diego and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I and Jaquez,” cried his comrade.</p>

<p>“Did not I forbid you to speak both at a time?” said the
prince: “you, Jaquez, answer; for the other fool seems more
distracted than thou art: what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“My gracious lord,” said Jaquez, “if it please your highness
to hear me, Diego and I, according to your highness’s orders,
went to search for the young lady; but being apprehensive
that we might meet the ghost of my young lord, your highness’s
son, God rest his soul! as he has not received Christian
burial&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sot!” cried Manfred, in a rage, “is it only a ghost, then,
that thou hast seen?”</p>

<p>“Oh, worse! worse! my lord,” cried Diego: “I had rather
have seen ten whole ghosts.”</p>

<p>“Grant me patience!” said Manfred; “those blockheads
distract me. Out of my sight, Diego; and thou, Jaquez, tell
me, in one word, art thou sober? art thou raving? thou wast
wont to have some sense; has the other sot frightened himself
and thee too? speak; what is it he fancies he has seen?”</p>

<p>“Why, my lord,” replied Jaquez, trembling. “I was going
to tell your highness, that since the calamitous misfortune of
my young lord, God rest his precious soul! not one of us, your
highness’s faithful servants, indeed we are, my lord, though
poor men; I say, not one of us has dared to set a foot about
the castle, but two together: so Diego and I, thinking that
my young lady might be in the great gallery, went up there
to look for her, and tell her your highness wanted something
to impart to her.”</p>

<p>“O blundering fools!” cried Manfred; “and in the meantime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
she has made her escape, because you were afraid of
goblins! Why, thou knave! she left me in the gallery; I came
from thence myself.”</p>

<p>“For all that, she may be there still for aught I know,” said
Jaquez; “but the devil shall have me before I seek her there
again: poor Diego! I do not believe he will ever recover it.”</p>

<p>“Recover what?” said Manfred; “am I never to learn what
it is has terrified these rascals? But I lose my time; follow me,
slave; I will see if she is in the gallery.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, my dear good lord,” cried Jaquez, “do
not go to the gallery! Satan himself, I believe, is in the chamber
next to the gallery.”</p>

<p>Manfred, who hitherto had treated the terror of his servants
as an idle panic, was struck at this new circumstance. He
recollected the apparition of the portrait, and the sudden closing
of the door at the end of the gallery&mdash;his voice faltered, and he
asked with disorder, “What is in the great chamber?”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Jaquez, “when Diego and I came into the
gallery, he went first, for he said he had more courage than I;&mdash;so,
when we came into the gallery, we found nobody. We looked
under every bench and stool; and still we found nobody.”</p>

<p>“Were all the pictures in their places?” said Manfred.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” answered Jaquez; “but we did not think of
looking behind them.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Manfred, “proceed.”</p>

<p>“When we came to the door of the great chamber,” continued
Jaquez, “we found it shut.”</p>

<p>“And could not you open it?” said Manfred.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, my lord; would to Heaven we had not!” replied
he: “nay, it was not I neither, it was Diego: he was grown foolhardy,
and would go on, though I advised him not: if ever I
open a door that is shut again!”</p>

<p>“Trifle not,” said Manfred, shuddering, “but tell me what
you saw in the great chamber, on opening the door.”</p>

<p>“I! my lord!” said Jaquez, “I saw nothing: I was behind
Diego; but I heard the noise.”</p>

<p>“Jaquez,” said Manfred, in a solemn tone of voice; “tell
me, I adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors, what was it
thou sawest? what was it thou heardest?”</p>

<p>“It was Diego saw it, my lord, it was not I,” replied Jaquez;
“I only heard the noise. Diego had no sooner opened the
door, than he cried out, and ran back&mdash;I ran back too, and
said, ‘Is it the ghost?’&mdash;‘The ghost! no, no,’ said Diego, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hair stood an end&mdash;‘it is a giant, I believe: he is all clad in
armour, for I saw his foot and part of his leg, and they are as
large as the helmet below in the court.’ As he said these words,
my lord, we heard a violent motion, and the rattling of armour,
as if the giant was rising, for Diego has told me since that he
believes the giant was lying down, for the foot and leg were
stretched at length on the floor. Before we could get to the
end of the gallery, we heard the door of the great chamber clap
behind us, but we did not dare turn back to see if the giant
was following us&mdash;yet, now I think on it, we must have heard
him if he pursued us; but for Heaven’s sake, good my lord, send
for the chaplain, and have the castle exorcized, for, for certain,
it is enchanted.”</p>

<p>“Ay, pray do, my lord,” cried all the servants at once, “or
we must leave your highness’s service.”</p>

<p>“Peace, dotards!” said Manfred, “and follow me; I will know
what all this means.”</p>

<p>“We! my lord?” cried they, with one voice; “we would not
go up to the gallery for your highness’s revenue.”</p>

<p>The young peasant, who had stood silent, now spoke. “Will
your highness,” said he, “permit me to try this adventure?
my life is of consequence to nobody; I fear no bad angel, and
have offended no good one.”</p>

<p>“Your behaviour is above your seeming,” said Manfred,
viewing him with surprise and admiration: “hereafter I will
reward your bravery; but now,” continued he with a sigh,
“I am so circumstanced, that I dare trust no eyes but my
own. However, I give you leave to accompany me.”</p>

<p>Manfred, when he first followed Isabella from the gallery,
had gone directly to the apartment of his wife, concluding the
princess had retired thither. Hippolita, who knew his step,
rose with anxious fondness to meet her lord, whom she had
not seen since the death of her son. She would have flown in
a transport, mixed of joy and grief, to his bosom, but he pushed
her rudely off, and said, “Where is Isabella?”</p>

<p>“Isabella, my lord!” said the astonished Hippolita.</p>

<p>“Yes, Isabella,” cried Manfred imperiously; “I want Isabella.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” replied Matilda, who perceived how much his
behaviour had shocked her mother, “she has not been with us
since your highness summoned her to your apartment.”</p>

<p>“Tell me where she is,” said the prince; “I do not want to
know where she has been.”</p>

<p>“My good lord,” says Hippolita, “your daughter tells you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the truth: Isabella left us by your command, and has not
returned since; but, my good lord, compose yourself: retire to
your rest; this dismal day has disordered you. Isabella shall
wait your orders in the morning.”</p>

<p>“What, then, you know where she is?” cried Manfred. “Tell
me directly, for I will not lose an instant; and you, woman,”
speaking to his wife, “order your chaplain to attend me
forthwith.”</p>

<p>“Isabella,” said Hippolita, calmly, “is retired, I suppose to
her chamber: she is not accustomed to watch at this late hour.
Gracious my lord,” continued she, “let me know what has
disturbed you. Has Isabella offended you?”</p>

<p>“Trouble me not with questions,” said Manfred, “but tell
me where she is.”</p>

<p>“Matilda shall call her,” said the princess. “Sit down, my
lord, and resume your wonted fortitude.”</p>

<p>“What! art thou jealous of Isabella?” replied he, “that you
wish to be present at our interview?”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! my lord,” said Hippolita; “what is it your
highness means?”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed,” said the
cruel prince. “Send your chaplain to me, and wait my pleasure
here.” At these words he flung out of the room in search of
Isabella, leaving the amazed ladies thunderstruck with his
words and frantic deportment, and lost in vain conjectures on
what he was meditating.</p>

<p>Manfred was now returning from the vault, attended by the
peasant and a few of his servants, whom he had obliged to
accompany him. He ascended the staircase without stopping,
till he arrived at the gallery, at the door of which he met Hippolita
and her chaplain. When Diego had been dismissed by
Manfred, he had gone directly to the princess’s apartment
with the alarm of what he had seen. That excellent lady,
who no more than Manfred doubted of the reality of the vision,
yet affected to treat it as a delirium of the servants. Willing,
however, to save her lord from any additional shock, and
prepared by a series of grief not to tremble at any accession to
it, she determined to make herself the first sacrifice, if fate had
marked the present hour for their destruction. Dismissing the
reluctant Matilda to her rest, who in vain sued for leave to
accompany her mother, and attended only by her chaplain,
Hippolita had visited the gallery and great chamber; and now,
with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
met her lord, and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg
and foot was all a fable; and no doubt an impression made by
fear, and the dark and dismal hour of the night, on the minds
of his servants. She and the chaplain had examined the
chamber, and found everything in the usual order.</p>

<p>Manfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had
been no work of fancy, recovered a little from the tempest of
mind into which so many strange events had thrown him.
Ashamed, too, of his inhuman treatment of a princess, who
returned every injury with new marks of tenderness and duty,
he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes; but not less
ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom he was
inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage, he curbed the
yearnings of his heart, and did not dare to lean even towards
pity. The next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy.
Presuming on the unshaken submission of Hippolita, he flattered
himself that she would not only acquiesce with patience to a
divorce, but would obey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring
to persuade Isabella to give him her hand&mdash;but ere he could
indulge this horrid hope, he reflected that Isabella was not to
be found. Coming to himself, he gave orders that every avenue
to the castle should be strictly guarded, and charged his domestics,
on pain of their lives, to suffer nobody to pass out. The
young peasant to whom he spoke favourably, he ordered to
remain in a small chamber on the stairs, in which there was a
pallet-bed, and the key of which he took away himself, telling
the youth he would talk with him in the morning. Then dismissing
his attendants, and bestowing a sullen kind of half-nod
on Hippolita, he retired to his own chamber.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>Matilda, who, by Hippolita’s order, had retired to her apartment,
was ill-disposed to take any rest. The shocking fate of
her brother had deeply affected her. She was surprised at
not seeing Isabella; but the strange words which had fallen
from her father, and his obscure menace to the princess, his
wife, accompanied by the most furious behaviour, had filled
her gentle mind with terror and alarm. She waited anxiously
for the return of Bianca, a young damsel that attended her,
whom she had sent to learn what was become of Isabella.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Bianca soon appeared, and informed her mistress of what she
had gathered from the servants, that Isabella was nowhere
to be found. She related the adventure of the young peasant
who had been discovered in the vault, though with many simple
additions from the incoherent accounts of the domestics; and
she dwelt principally on the gigantic leg and foot which had
been seen in the gallery-chamber. This last circumstance had
terrified Bianca so much, that she was rejoiced when Matilda
told her that she would not go to rest, but would watch till
the princess should rise.</p>

<p>The young princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight
of Isabella, and on the threats of Manfred to her mother. “But
what business could he have so urgent with the chaplain?”
said Matilda. “Does he intend to have my brother’s body
interred privately in the chapel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, madam,” said Bianca, “now I guess. As you are
become his heiress, he is impatient to have you married. He
has always been raving for more sons; I warrant he is now
impatient for grandsons. As sure as I live, madam, I shall see
you a bride at last. Good madam, you won’t cast off your
faithful Bianca: you won’t put Donna Rossara over me, now
you are a great princess!”</p>

<p>“My poor Bianca,” said Matilda, “how fast your thoughts
ramble! I a great princess! What hast thou seen in Manfred’s
behaviour since my brother’s death that bespeaks any
increase of tenderness to me? No, Bianca; his heart was ever
a stranger to me&mdash;but he is my father, and I must not complain.
Nay, if Heaven shuts my father’s heart against me, it
overpays my little merit in the tenderness of my mother.&mdash;O that
dear mother! Yes, Bianca, ’tis there I feel the rugged temper
of Manfred. I can support his harshness to me with patience;
but it wounds my soul when I am witness to his causeless severity
towards her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, madam,” said Bianca, “all men use their wives so,
when they are weary of them.”</p>

<p>“And yet you congratulated me but now,” said Matilda,
“when you fancied my father intended to dispose of me!”</p>

<p>“I would have you a great lady,” replied Bianca, “come
what will. I do not wish to see you moped in a convent, as
you would be if you had your will, and if my lady, your mother,
who knows that a bad husband is better than no husband at
all, did not hinder you.&mdash;Bless me! what noise is that? St.
Nicholas forgive me! I was but in jest.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
“It is the wind,” said Matilda, “whistling through the battlements
in the tower above. You have heard it a thousand times.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Bianca, “there was no harm neither in what
I said: it is no sin to talk of matrimony&mdash;and so, madam, as I
was saying, if my Lord Manfred should offer you a handsome
young prince for a bridegroom, you would drop him a curtsy,
and tell him you would rather take the veil?”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven! I am in no such danger,” said Matilda:
“you know how many proposals for me he has rejected.”</p>

<p>“And you thank him like a dutiful daughter, do you, madam?&mdash;but
come, madam; suppose to-morrow morning he was to
send for you to the great council-chamber, and there you
should find at his elbow a lovely young prince, with large
black eyes, a smooth white forehead, and manly curling locks
like jet; in short, madam, a young hero resembling the picture
of the good Alfonso in the gallery, which you sit and gaze at
for hours together.”</p>

<p>“Do not speak lightly of that picture,” interrupted Matilda,
sighing: “I know the adoration with which I look at that
picture is uncommon&mdash;but I am not in love with a coloured
panel. The character of that virtuous prince, the veneration
with which my mother has inspired me for his memory, the
orisons which, I know not why, she has enjoined me to pour
forth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that,
somehow or other, my destiny is linked with something relating
to him.”</p>

<p>“Lord, madam! how should that be?” said Bianca: “I have
always heard that your family was no way related to his; and
I am sure I cannot conceive why my lady, the princess, sends
you in a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb:
he is no saint by the almanac. If you must pray, why does
she not bid you address yourself to our great St. Nicholas?
I am sure he is the saint I pray to for a husband.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps my mind would be less affected,” said Matilda,
“if my mother would explain her reasons to me; but it is the
mystery she observes, that inspires me with this&mdash;I know not
what to call it. As she never acts from caprice, I am sure there
is some fatal secret at bottom&mdash;nay, I know there is. In her
agony of grief for my brother’s death she dropped some words
that intimated as much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear madam,” cried Bianca, “what were they?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Matilda, “if a parent lets fall a word, and wishes
it recalled, it is not for a child to utter it.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“What! was she sorry for what she had said?” asked Bianca.
“I am sure, madam, you may trust me.”</p>

<p>“With my own little secrets, when I have any, I may,” said
Matilda; “but never with my mother’s. A child ought to have
no ears or eyes, but as a parent directs.”</p>

<p>“Well, to be sure, madam, you were born to be a saint,” said
Bianca, “and there is no resisting one’s vocation: you will end
in a convent at last. But there is my Lady Isabella would not
be so reserved to me: she will let me talk to her of young men;
and when a handsome cavalier has come to the castle, she has
owned to me that she wished your brother Conrad resembled him.”</p>

<p>“Bianca,” said the princess, “I do not allow you to mention
my friend disrespectfully. Isabella is of a cheerful disposition,
but her soul is as pure as virtue itself. She knows your idling,
babbling humour, and perhaps has now and then encouraged it,
to divert melancholy, and enliven the solitude in which my
father keeps us.”</p>

<p>“Blessed Mary!” said Bianca, starting, “there it is again!
Dear madam, do you hear nothing? The castle is certainly
haunted!”</p>

<p>“Peace!” said Matilda, “and listen! I did think I heard a
voice&mdash;but it must be fancy; your terrors, I suppose, have
infected me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! indeed! madam,” said Bianca, half weeping with
agony, “I am sure I heard a voice.”</p>

<p>“Does anybody lie in the chamber beneath?” said the
princess.</p>

<p>“Nobody has dared to lie there,” answered Bianca, “since
the great astrologer, that was your brother’s tutor, drowned
himself. For certain, madam, his ghost and the young prince’s
are now met in the chamber below; for Heaven’s sake let us fly
to your mother’s apartment!”</p>

<p>“I charge you not to stir,” said Matilda. “If they are
spirits in pain, we may ease their sufferings by questioning them.
They can mean no hurt to us, for we have not injured them; and
if they should, shall we be more safe in one chamber than in
another? Reach me my beads; we will say a prayer, and then
speak to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world,”
cried Bianca. As she said these words, they heard the casement
of the little chamber below Matilda’s open. They listened
attentively, and in a few minutes thought they heard a person
sing, but could not distinguish the words.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
“This can be no evil spirit,” said the princess, in a low voice:
“it is undoubtedly one of the family&mdash;open the window, and
we shall know the voice.”</p>

<p>“I dare not, indeed, madam,” said Bianca.</p>

<p>“Thou art a very fool,” said Matilda, opening the window
gently herself. The noise that the princess made was, however,
heard by the person beneath, who stopped, and they concluded
had heard the casement open.</p>

<p>“Is anybody below?” said the princess: “if there is, speak.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said an unknown voice.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“A stranger,” replied the voice.</p>

<p>“What stranger?” said she, “and how didst thou come here
at this unusual hour, when all the gates of the castle are
locked?”</p>

<p>“I am not here willingly,” answered the voice; “but pardon
me, lady, if I have disturbed your rest: I knew not that I was
overheard. Sleep has forsaken me: I left a restless couch, and
came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach
of morning, impatient to be dismissed from this castle.”</p>

<p>“Thy words and accents,” said Matilda, “are of a melancholy
cast: if thou art unhappy, I pity thee. If poverty afflicts thee,
let me know it: I will mention thee to the princess, whose
beneficent soul ever melts for the distressed; and she will
relieve thee.”</p>

<p>“I am, indeed, unhappy,” said the stranger, “and I know
not what wealth is; but I do not complain of the lot which
Heaven has cast for me. I am young and healthy and am not
ashamed of owing my support to myself; yet think me not
proud, or that I disdain your generous offers. I will remember
you in my orisons, and I will pray for blessings on your gracious
self and your noble mistress&mdash;if I sigh, lady, it is for others, not
for myself.”</p>

<p>“Now I have it, madam,” said Bianca, whispering the
princess. “This is certainly the young peasant; and, by my
conscience, he is in love:&mdash;well, this is a charming adventure!
Do, madam, let us sift him. He does not know you, but takes
you for one of my Lady Hippolita’s women.”</p>

<p>“Art thou not ashamed, Bianca?” said the princess. “What
right have we to pry into the secrets of this young man’s heart?
He seems virtuous and frank, and tells us he is unhappy. Are
those circumstances that authorize us to make a property of
him? How are we entitled to his confidence?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
“Lord! madam, how little you know of love!” replied
Bianca: “why, lovers have no pleasure equal to talking of
their mistress.”</p>

<p>“And would you have me become a peasant’s confidant?”
said the princess.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let me talk to him,” said Bianca: “though
I have the honour of being your highness’s maid of honour, I
was not always so great. Besides, if love levels ranks, it raises
them too: I have a respect for a young man in love.”</p>

<p>“Peace, simpleton,” said the princess. “Though he said he
was unhappy, it does not follow that he must be in love. Think
of all that has happened to-day, and tell me, if there are no
misfortunes but what love causes.&mdash;Stranger,” resumed the
princess, “if thy misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy
own fault, and are within the compass of the Princess Hippolita’s
power to redress, I will take upon me to answer that she will be
thy protectress. When thou art dismissed from this castle,
repair to holy Father Jerome, at the convent adjoining to the
church of St. Nicholas, and make thy story known to him, as
far as thou thinkest meet. He will not fail to inform the
princess, who is the mother of all that want her assistance.
Farewell! It is not seemly for me to hold further converse
with a man at this unwonted hour.”</p>

<p>“May the saints guard thee, gracious lady!” replied the
peasant; “but, oh! if a poor and worthless stranger might
presume to beg a minute’s audience further&mdash;am I so happy?&mdash;the
casement is not shut&mdash;might I venture to ask&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speak quickly,” said Matilda; “the morning dawns apace;
should the labourers come into the fields and perceive us&mdash;what
wouldst thou ask?”</p>

<p>“I know not how&mdash;I know not if I dare,” said the young
stranger, faltering; “yet the humanity with which you have
spoken to me emboldens&mdash;lady, dare I trust you?”</p>

<p>“Heavens,” said Matilda, “what dost thou mean? with what
wouldst thou trust me?&mdash;speak boldly, if thy secret is fit to be
entrusted to a virtuous breast.”</p>

<p>“I would ask,” said the peasant, recollecting himself, “whether
what I have heard from the domestics is true, that the princess
is missing from the castle.”</p>

<p>“What imports it to thee to know?” replied Matilda: “thy
first words bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity. Dost
thou come hither to pry into the secrets of Manfred? Adieu.
I have been mistaken in thee.” Saying these words, she shut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the casement hastily, without giving the young man time
to reply.</p>

<p>“I had acted more wisely,” said the princess to Bianca, with
some sharpness, “if I had let thee converse with this peasant:
his inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own.”</p>

<p>“It is not fit for me to argue with your highness,” replied
Bianca; “but perhaps the questions I should have put to him
would have been more to the purpose than those you have been
pleased to ask him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no doubt,” said Matilda; “you are a very discreet
personage! may I know what you would have asked him?”</p>

<p>“A bystander often sees more of the game than those that
play,” answered Bianca. “Does your highness think, madam,
that his question about my Lady Isabella was the result of
mere curiosity? No, no, madam; there is more in it than you
great folks are aware of. Lopez told me, that all the servants
believe this young fellow contrived my Lady Isabella’s escape&mdash;now,
pray, madam, observe&mdash;you and I both know that my
Lady Isabella never much fancied the prince your brother&mdash;well,
he is killed just in the critical minute&mdash;I accuse nobody.
A helmet falls from the moon&mdash;so my lord, your father, says;
but Lopez and all the servants say, that this young spark is a
magician, and stole it from Alfonso’s tomb.”</p>

<p>“Have done with this rhapsody of impertinence,” said
Matilda.</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, as you please,” cried Bianca; “yet it is very
particular, though, that my Lady Isabella should be missing
the very same day, and that this young sorcerer should be
found at the mouth of the trap-door&mdash;I accuse nobody&mdash;but if
my young lord came honestly by his death&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dare not, on thy duty,” said Matilda, “to breathe a suspicion
on the purity of my dear Isabella’s fame.”</p>

<p>“Purity or not purity,” said Bianca, “gone she is&mdash;a stranger
is found that nobody knows. You question him yourself. He
tells you he is in love, or unhappy, it is the same thing&mdash;nay,
he owned he was unhappy about others; and is anybody
unhappy about another unless they are in love with them?
and at the very next word he asks innocently, poor soul, if my
Lady Isabella is missing.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Matilda, “thy observations are not totally
without foundation; Isabella’s flight amazes me. The curiosity
of the stranger is very particular; yet Isabella never concealed
a thought from me.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
“So she told you,” said Bianca, “to fish out your secrets;
but who knows, madam, but this stranger may be some prince
in disguise? Do, madam, let me open the window, and ask
him a few questions.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Matilda, “I will ask him myself: if he knows
aught of Isabella, he is not worthy that I should converse
farther with him.” She was going to open the casement, when
they heard the bell ring at the postern gate of the castle, which
is on the right hand of the tower where Matilda lay. This
prevented the princess from renewing the conversation with
the stranger.</p>

<p>After continuing silent for some time, “I am persuaded,”
said she to Bianca, “that whatever be the cause of Isabella’s
flight, it had no unworthy motive. If this stranger was accessory
to it, she must be satisfied of his fidelity and worth. I observed,
did not you, Bianca? that his words were tinctured with an
uncommon infusion of piety. It was no ruffian’s speech: his
phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth.”</p>

<p>“I told you, madam,” said Bianca, “that I was sure he was
some prince in disguise.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” said Matilda, “if he was privy to her escape how
will you account for his not accompanying her in her flight?
Why expose himself unnecessarily and rashly to my father’s
resentment?”</p>

<p>“As for that, madam,” replied she, “if he could get from under
the helmet, he will find ways of eluding your father’s anger. I do
not doubt but he has some talisman or other about him.”</p>

<p>“You resolve everything into magic,” said Matilda; “but a
man who has any intercourse with infernal spirits does not
dare to make use of those tremendous and holy words which
he uttered. Didst thou not observe with what fervour he vowed
to remember me to Heaven in his prayers? yes; Isabella was
undoubtedly convinced of his piety.”</p>

<p>“Commend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel
that consult to elope!” said Bianca. “No, no, madam; my
Lady Isabella is of another guess-mould than you take her
for. She used, indeed, to sigh and lift up her eyes in your
company, because she knows you are a saint; but when your
back was turned&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You wrong her,” said Matilda. “Isabella is no hypocrite:
she has a due sense of devotion, but never affected a call she has
not. On the contrary, she always combated my inclination for
the cloister; and though I own the mystery she has made to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of her flight confounds me&mdash;though it seems inconsistent with
the friendship between us&mdash;I cannot forget the disinterested
warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil:
she wished to see me married, though my dower would have
been a loss to her and my brother’s children. For her sake,
I will believe well of this young peasant.”</p>

<p>“Then you do think there is some liking between them?”
said Bianca. While she was speaking, a servant came hastily
into the chamber, and told the princess that the Lady Isabella
was found.</p>

<p>“Where?” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“She has taken sanctuary in St. Nicholas’s church,” replied
the servant: “Father Jerome has brought the news himself;
he is below with his highness.”</p>

<p>“Where is my mother?” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“She is in her own chamber, madam, and has asked for you.”</p>

<p>Manfred had risen at the first dawn of light, and gone to
Hippolita’s apartment, to inquire if she knew aught of Isabella.
While he was questioning her, word was brought that Jerome
demanded to speak with him. Manfred, little suspecting the
cause of the friar’s arrival, and knowing he was employed
by Hippolita in her charities, ordered him to be admitted,
intending to leave them together, while he pursued his search
after Isabella.</p>

<p>“Is your business with me or the princess?” said Manfred.</p>

<p>“With both,” replied the holy man. “The Lady Isabella&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What of her?” interrupted Manfred, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Is at St. Nicholas’s altar,” replied Jerome.</p>

<p>“That is no business of Hippolita’s,” said Manfred with confusion:
“let us retire to my chamber, father, and inform me
how she came thither.”</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” replied the good man with an air of firmness
and authority, that daunted even the resolute Manfred, who
could not help revering the saint-like virtues of Jerome, “my
commission is to both; and, with your highness’s good liking,
in the presence of both, I shall deliver it: but first, my lord, I
must interrogate the princess, whether she is acquainted with
the cause of the Lady Isabella’s retirement from your castle.”</p>

<p>“No, on my soul,” said Hippolita: “does Isabella charge me
with being privy to it?”</p>

<p>“Father,” interrupted Manfred, “I pay due reverence to your
holy profession; but I am sovereign here, and will allow no
meddling priest to interfere in the affairs of my domestic. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
you have aught to say, attend me to my chamber. I do not
use to let my wife be acquainted with the secret affairs of my
state: they are not within a woman’s province.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said the holy man, “I am no intruder into the
secrets of families. My office is to promote peace, to heal divisions,
to preach repentance, and teach mankind to curb their
headstrong passions. I forgive your highness’s uncharitable
apostrophe: I know my duty, and am the minister of a mightier
prince than Manfred. Hearken to him who speaks through
my organs.”</p>

<p>Manfred trembled with rage and shame. Hippolita’s countenance
declared her astonishment and impatience to know
where this would end: her silence more strongly spoke her
observance of Manfred.</p>

<p>“The Lady Isabella,” resumed Jerome, “commends herself
to both your highnesses: she thanks both for the kindness
with which she has been treated in your castle: she deplores
the loss of your son, and her own misfortune in not becoming
the daughter of such wise and noble princes, whom she shall
always respect as parents: she prays for uninterrupted union
and felicity between you (Manfred’s colour changed); but, as it
is no longer possible for her to be allied to you, she entreats
your consent to remain in sanctuary till she can learn news
of her father, or, by the certainty of his death, be at liberty,
by the approbation of her guardians, to dispose of herself in
suitable marriage.”</p>

<p>“I shall give no such consent,” said the prince; “but insist
on her return to the castle without delay: I am answerable for
her person to her guardians, and will not brook her being in
any hands but my own.”</p>

<p>“Your highness will recollect whether that can any longer
be proper,” replied the friar.</p>

<p>“I want no monitor,” said Manfred, colouring: “Isabella’s
conduct leaves room for strange suspicions; and that young
villain, who was at least the accomplice of her flight, if not
the cause of it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The cause!” interrupted Jerome; “was a <i>young</i> man the
cause?”</p>

<p>“This is not to be borne!” cried Manfred. “Am I to be
bearded in my own palace by an insolent monk? thou art privy,
I guess, to their amours.”</p>

<p>“I would pray to Heaven to clear up your uncharitable
surmises,” said Jerome, “if your highness were not satisfied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in your conscience how unjustly you accuse me. I do pray to
Heaven to pardon that uncharitableness; and I implore your
highness to leave the princess at peace in that holy place, where
she is not liable to be disturbed by such vain and worldly
fantasies as discourses of love from any man.”</p>

<p>“Cant not to me,” said Manfred, “but return and bring
the princess to her duty.”</p>

<p>“It is my duty to prevent her return hither,” said Jerome.
“She is where orphans and virgins are safest from the snares
and wiles of this world; and nothing but a parent’s authority
shall take her thence.”</p>

<p>“I am her parent,” cried Manfred, “and demand her.”</p>

<p>“She wished to have you for her parent,” said the friar: “but
Heaven, that forbade that connection, has for ever dissolved all
ties betwixt you: and I announce to your highness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop! audacious man,” said Manfred, “and dread my
displeasure.”</p>

<p>“Holy father,” said Hippolita, “it is your office to be no
respecter of persons: you must speak as your duty prescribes;
but it is my duty to hear nothing that it pleases not my lord
I should hear. Attend the prince to his chamber. I will retire
to my oratory, and pray to the blessed Virgin to inspire you
with her holy counsels, and to restore the heart of my gracious
lord to its wonted peace and gentleness.”</p>

<p>“Excellent woman!” said the friar.&mdash;“My lord, I attend
your pleasure.”</p>

<p>Manfred, accompanied by the friar, passed to his own apartment,
where, shutting the door, “I perceive, father,” said he,
“that Isabella has acquainted you with my purpose. Now
hear my resolve, and obey. Reasons of state, most urgent
reasons, my own and the safety of my people, demand that I
should have a son. It is in vain to expect an heir from Hippolita;
I have made choice of Isabella. You must bring her
back, and you must do more. I know the influence you have
with Hippolita: her conscience is in your hands. She is, I
allow, a faultless woman: her soul is set on heaven, and scorns
the little grandeur of this world: you can withdraw her from it
entirely. Persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our
marriage, and to retire into a monastery: she shall endow one
if she will; and shall have the means of being as liberal to your
order as she or you can wish. Thus you will divert the calamities
that are hanging over our heads, and have the merit of saving
the principality of Otranto from destruction. You are a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
prudent man, and, though the warmth of my temper betrayed
me into some unbecoming expressions, I honour your virtue,
and wish to be indebted to you for the repose of my life and
the preservation of my family.”</p>

<p>“The will of Heaven be done,” said the friar. “I am but
its worthless instrument. It makes use of my tongue to tell
thee, prince, of thy unwarrantable designs. The injuries of the
virtuous Hippolita have mounted to the throne of pity. By
me thou art reprimanded for thy adulterous intention of
repudiating her: by me thou art warned not to pursue the
incestuous design on thy contracted daughter. Heaven, that
delivered her from thy fury, when the judgments so recently
fallen on thy house ought to have inspired thee with other
thoughts, will continue to watch over her. Even I, a poor
and despised friar, am able to protect her from thy violence.
I, sinner as I am, and uncharitably reviled by your highness as
an accomplice of I know not what amours, scorn the allurements
with which it has pleased thee to tempt mine honesty.
I love my order; I honour devout souls; I respect the piety of
thy princess; but I will not betray the confidence she reposes
in me, nor serve even the cause of religion by foul and sinful
compliances: but, forsooth, the welfare of the state depends on
your highness having a son! Heaven mocks the short-sighted
views of man. But yester-morn, whose house was so great, so
flourishing as Manfred’s? Where is young Conrad now? My
lord, I respect your tears, but I mean not to check them: let
them flow, prince! they will weigh more with Heaven towards
the welfare of thy subjects, than a marriage which, founded on
lust or policy, could never prosper. The sceptre which passed
from the race of Alfonso to thine cannot be preserved by a
match which the Church will never allow. If it is the will of
the Most High that Manfred’s name must perish, resign yourself,
my lord, to its decrees; and thus deserve a crown that can never
pass away. Come, my lord, I like this sorrow; let us return
to the princess; she is not apprised of your cruel intentions;
nor did I mean more than to alarm you. You saw with what
gentle patience, with what efforts of love, she heard, she rejected
hearing, the extent of your guilt. I know she longs to fold you
in her arms, and assure you of her unalterable affection.”</p>

<p>“Father,” said the prince, “you mistake my compunction.
True, I honour Hippolita’s virtues; I think her a saint; and
wish it were for my soul’s health to tie faster the knot that
has united us; but, alas, father, you know not the bitterest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
my pangs; it is some time that I have had scruples on the legality
of our union: Hippolita is related to me in the fourth degree&mdash;it
is true, we had a dispensation: but I have been informed,
that she had also been contracted to another. This it is that sits
heavy at my heart; to this state of unlawful wedlock I impute the
visitation that has fallen on me in the death of Conrad. Ease
my conscience of this burden, dissolve our marriage, and
accomplish the work of godliness which your divine exhortations
have commenced in my soul.”</p>

<p>How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt, when
he perceived this turn in the wily prince! He trembled for
Hippolita, whose ruin he saw was determined; and he feared if
Manfred had no hope of recovering Isabella, that his impatience
for a son would direct him to some other object who might
not be equally proof against the temptation of Manfred’s rank.
For some time the holy man remained absorbed in thought.
At length, conceiving some hopes from delay, he thought the
wisest conduct would be to prevent the prince from despairing
of recovering Isabella. Her the friar knew he could dispose,
from her affection to Hippolita, and from the aversion she had
expressed to him for Manfred’s addresses, to second his views
till the censures of the Church could be fulminated against a
divorce. With this intention, as if struck with the prince’s
scruples, he at length said:</p>

<p>“My lord, I have been pondering on what your highness has
said; and if in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real
motive of your repugnance to your virtuous lady, far be it
from me to endeavour to harden your heart. The Church is
an indulgent mother; unfold your griefs to her; she alone can
administer comfort to your soul, either by satisfying your
conscience, or, upon examination of your scruples, by setting
you at liberty, and indulging you in the lawful means of continuing
your lineage. In the latter case, if the Lady Isabella
can be brought to consent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Manfred, who concluded that he had either over-reached the
good man, or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid
to appearance, was overjoyed at this sudden turn, and repeated
the most magnificent promises, if he should succeed by the
friar’s mediation. The well-meaning priest suffered him to
deceive himself, fully determined to traverse his views, instead
of seconding them.</p>

<p>“Since we now understand one another,” resumed the prince,
“I expect, father, that you satisfy me in one point. Who is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the youth that I found in the vault? He must have been
privy to Isabella’s flight. Tell me truly, is he her lover? or is
he an agent for another’s passion? I have often suspected
Isabella’s indifference to my son; a thousand circumstances
crowd on my mind that confirm that suspicion. She herself
was so conscious of it, that while I discoursed her in the gallery
she outran my suspicions, and endeavoured to justify herself
from coolness to Conrad.”</p>

<p>The friar, who knew nothing of the youth but what he had
learnt occasionally from the princess, ignorant what was become
of him, and not sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of
Manfred’s temper, conceived that it might not be amiss to sow
the seeds of jealousy in his mind: they might be turned to some
use hereafter, either by prejudicing the prince against Isabella,
if he persisted in that union; or, by diverting his attention to
a wrong scent, and employing his thoughts on a visionary
intrigue, prevent his engaging in any new pursuit. With this
unhappy policy, he answered in a manner to confirm Manfred
in the belief of some connection between Isabella and the youth.
The prince, whose passions wanted little fuel to throw them into a
blaze, fell into a rage at the idea of what the friar had suggested.</p>

<p>“I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue,” cried he; and
quitting Jerome abruptly, with a command to remain there
till his return, he hastened to the great hall of the castle, and
ordered the peasant to be brought before him.</p>

<p>“Thou hardened young impostor,” said the prince, as soon
as he saw the youth; “what becomes of thy boasted veracity
now? It was Providence, was it, and the light of the moon,
that discovered the lock of the trap-door to thee? Tell me,
audacious boy, who thou art, and how long thou hast been
acquainted with the princess; and take care to answer with less
equivocation than thou didst last night, or tortures shall wring
the truth from thee.”</p>

<p>The young man, perceiving that his share in the flight of
the princess was discovered, and concluding that anything he
should say could no longer be of service or detriment to her,
replied, “I am no impostor, my lord, nor have I deserved
opprobrious language. I answered to every question your
highness put to me last night with the same veracity that I
shall speak now; and that will not be from fear of your tortures,
but because my soul abhors a falsehood. Please to repeat
your questions, my lord; I am ready to give you all the
satisfaction in my power.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
“You know my questions,” replied the prince, “and only
want time to prepare an evasion. Speak directly; who art
thou, and how long hast thou been known to the princess?”</p>

<p>“I am a labourer at the next village,” said the peasant;
“my name is Theodore. The princess found me in the vault
last night; before that hour I never was in her presence.”</p>

<p>“I may believe as much or as little as I please of this,” said
Manfred; “but I will hear thy own story, before I examine into
the truth of it. Tell me, what reason did the princess give thee
for making her escape? Thy life depends on thy answer.”</p>

<p>“She told me,” replied Theodore, “that she was on the brink
of destruction, and that if she could not escape from the castle,
she was in danger in a few moments of being made miserable
for ever.”</p>

<p>“And on this slight foundation, on a silly girl’s report,” said
Manfred, “thou didst hazard my displeasure!”</p>

<p>“I fear no man’s displeasure,” said Theodore, “when a
woman in distress puts herself under my protection.”</p>

<p>During this examination Matilda was going to the apartment
of Hippolita. At the upper end of the hall, where Manfred sat,
was a boarded gallery, with latticed windows, through which
Matilda and Bianca were to pass. Hearing her father’s voice,
and seeing the servants assembled round him, she stopped to
learn the occasion. The prisoner soon drew her attention: the
steady and composed manner in which he answered, and the
gallantry of his last reply, which were the first words she heard
distinctly, interested her in his favour. His person was noble,
handsome, and commanding, even in that situation, but his
countenance soon engrossed her whole care.</p>

<p>“Heavens! Bianca,” said the princess softly, “do I dream,
or is not that youth the exact resemblance of Alfonso’s picture
in the gallery?” She could say no more, for her father’s voice
grew louder at every word.</p>

<p>“This bravado,” said he, “surpasses all thy former insolence.
Thou shalt experience the wrath with which thou darest to
trifle. Seize him,” continued Manfred, “and bind him&mdash;the
first news the princess hears of her champion shall be, that he
has lost his head for her sake.”</p>

<p>“The injustice of which thou art guilty towards me,” said
Theodore, “convinces me that I have done a good deed in
delivering the princess from thy tyranny. May she be happy,
whatever becomes of me!”</p>

<p>“This is a lover,” cried Manfred, in a rage; “a peasant within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sight of death is not animated by such sentiments. Tell me,
tell me, rash boy, who thou art, or the rack shall force thy secret
from thee.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast threatened me with death already,” said the
youth, “for the truth I have told thee; if that is all the encouragement
I am to expect for sincerity, I am not tempted to indulge
thy vain curiosity further.”</p>

<p>“Then thou wilt not speak?” said Manfred.</p>

<p>“I will not,” replied he.</p>

<p>“Bear him away into the court-yard,” said Manfred; “I will
see his head this instant severed from his body.”</p>

<p>Matilda fainted at hearing those words. Bianca shrieked
and cried, “Help, help! the princess is dead!” Manfred started
at this ejaculation, and demanded what was the matter. The
young peasant, who heard it too, was struck with horror, and
asked eagerly the same question; but Manfred ordered him to
be hurried into the court, and kept there for execution, till he
had informed himself of the cause of Bianca’s shrieks. When
he learned the meaning, he treated it as a womanish panic,
and ordering Matilda to be carried to her apartment, he rushed
into the court, and calling for one of his guards, bade Theodore
kneel down and prepare to receive the fatal blow.</p>

<p>The undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a
resignation that touched every heart but Manfred’s. He
wished earnestly to know the meaning of the words he had
heard relating to the princess; but fearing to exasperate the
tyrant more against her, he desisted. The only boon he deigned
to ask was, that he might be permitted to have a confessor, and
make his peace with Heaven. Manfred, who hoped by the
confessor’s means to come at the youth’s history, readily granted
his request; and being convinced that Father Jerome was now
in his interest, he ordered him to be called and shrive the prisoner.
The holy man, who had little foreseen the catastrophe that his
imprudence occasioned, fell on his knees to the prince, and
adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent
blood. He accused himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion,
endeavoured to exculpate the youth, and left no method
untried to soften the tyrant’s rage. Manfred, more incensed
than appeased by Jerome’s intercession, whose retraction now
made him suspect he had been imposed upon by both, commanded
the friar to do his duty, telling him he would not allow
the prisoner many minutes for confession.</p>

<p>“Nor do I ask many, my lord,” said the unhappy young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
man. “My sins, thank Heaven, have not been numerous;
nor exceed what might be expected at my years. Dry your
tears, good father, and let us dispatch: this is a bad world;
nor have I had cause to leave it with regret.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wretched youth!” said Jerome, “how canst thou
bear the sight of me with patience? I am thy murderer! it is
I have brought this dismal hour upon thee!”</p>

<p>“I forgive thee from my soul,” said the youth, “as I hope
Heaven will pardon me. Hear my confession, father, and give
me thy blessing.”</p>

<p>“How can I prepare thee for thy passage as I ought?” said
Jerome. “Thou canst not be saved without pardoning thy
foes, and canst thou forgive that impious man there?”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Theodore; “and do.”</p>

<p>“And does not this touch thee, cruel prince?” said the friar.</p>

<p>“I sent for thee to confess him,” said Manfred, sternly;
“not to plead for him. Thou didst first incense me against
him; his blood be upon thy head.”</p>

<p>“It will, it will!” said the good man, in an agony of sorrow.
“Thou and I must never hope to go where this blessed youth
is going.”</p>

<p>“Dispatch,” said Manfred; “I am no more to be moved by
the whining of priests than by the shrieks of women.”</p>

<p>“What!” said the youth; “is it possible that my fate could
have occasioned what I heard? Is the princess, then, again
in thy power?”</p>

<p>“Thou dost but remember me of my wrath,” said Manfred;
“prepare thee, for this moment is thy last.”</p>

<p>The youth, who felt his indignation rise, and who was touched
with the sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators,
as well as into the friar, suppressed his emotions, and
putting off his doublet, and unbuttoning his collar, knelt down
to his prayers. As he stooped, his shirt slipped down below
his shoulder, and discovered the mark of a bloody arrow.</p>

<p>“Gracious Heaven!” cried the holy man, starting, “what do
I see? It is my child, my Theodore!”</p>

<p>The passions that ensued must be conceived; they cannot
be painted. The tears of the assistants were suspended by
wonder, rather than stopped by joy. They seemed to inquire
into the eyes of their lord what they ought to feel. Surprise,
doubt, tenderness, respect, succeeded each other in the countenance
of the youth. He received with modest submission the
effusion of the old man’s tears and embraces; yet, afraid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
giving a loose to hope, and suspecting, from what had passed,
the inflexibility of Manfred’s temper, he cast a glance towards
the prince, as if to say, Canst thou be unmoved at such a scene
as this?</p>

<p>Manfred’s heart was capable of being touched. He forgot
his anger in his astonishment; yet his pride forbade his owning
himself affected. He even doubted whether this discovery
was not a contrivance of the friar to save the youth. “What
may this mean?” said he; “how can he be thy son? Is it
consistent with thy profession or reputed sanctity to avow a
peasant’s offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amours?”</p>

<p>“Oh God!” said the holy man, “dost thou question his being
mine? Could I feel the anguish I do, if I were not his father?
Spare him, good prince! spare him! and revile me as thou
pleasest.”</p>

<p>“Spare him! spare him!” cried the attendants, “for this
good man’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Peace!” said Manfred, sternly; “I must know, ere I am
disposed to pardon. A saint’s bastard may be no saint himself.”</p>

<p>“Injurious lord!” said Theodore; “add not insult to cruelty.
If I am this venerable man’s son, though no prince, as thou art,
know, the blood that flows in my veins&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the friar, interrupting him, “his blood is noble;
nor is he that abject thing, my lord, you speak him. He is my
lawful son; and Sicily can boast of few houses more ancient
than that of Falconara&mdash;but, alas! my lord, what is blood?
what is nobility? We are all reptiles, miserable, sinful creatures.
It is piety alone that can distinguish us from the dust whence
we sprung, and whither we must return.”</p>

<p>“Truce to your sermon,” said Manfred; “you forget you
are no longer Friar Jerome, but the Count of Falconara. Let
me know your history: you will have time enough to moralize
hereafter, if you should not happen to obtain the grace of that
sturdy criminal there.”</p>

<p>“Mother of God!” said the friar, “is it possible my lord can
refuse a father the life of his only, his long-lost child? Trample
me, my lord, scorn, afflict me, accept my life for his, but spare
my son!”</p>

<p>“Thou canst feel, then,” said Manfred, “what it is to lose an
only son! A little hour ago thou didst preach up resignation
to me: <i>my</i> house, if fate so pleased, must perish&mdash;but the Count
of Falconara&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Alas! my lord,” said Jerome, “I confess I have offended;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
but aggravate not an old man’s sufferings. I boast not of my
family, nor think of such vanities; it is nature that pleads for
this boy; it is the memory of the dear woman that bore him&mdash;is
she, Theodore, is she dead?”</p>

<p>“Her soul has long been with the blessed,” said Theodore.</p>

<p>“Oh! how?” cried Jerome; “tell me&mdash;no&mdash;she is happy!
Thou art all my care now. Most dread lord! will you&mdash;will
you grant me my poor boy’s life?”</p>

<p>“Return to thy convent,” answered Manfred; “conduct the
princess hither; obey me in what else thou knowest, and I
promise thee the life of thy son.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord!” said Jerome, “is my honesty the price I
must pay for this dear youth’s safety?”</p>

<p>“For me!” cried Theodore; “let me die a thousand deaths,
rather than stain thy conscience. What is it the tyrant would
exact of thee? Is the princess still safe from his power?
Protect her, thou venerable old man, and let all the weight of
his wrath fall on me.”</p>

<p>Jerome endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth;
and ere Manfred could reply, the trampling of horses was
heard, and a brazen trumpet, which hung without the gate of
the castle, was suddenly sounded. At the same instant the
sable plumes on the enchanted helmet, which still remained at
the other end of the court, were tempestuously agitated, and
nodded thrice, as if bowed by some invisible wearer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>Manfred’s heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on
the miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of
the brazen trumpet. “Father,” said he to Jerome, whom he
now ceased to treat as Count of Falconara, “what mean these
portents? If I have offended”&mdash;the plumes were shaken with
greater violence than before. “Unhappy prince that I am!”
cried Manfred. “Holy father, will you not assist me with
your prayers?”</p>

<p>“My lord,” replied Jerome, “Heaven is no doubt displeased
with your mockery of its servants. Submit yourself to the
Church, and cease to persecute her ministers. Dismiss this
innocent youth, and learn to respect the holy character I wear:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Heaven will not be trifled with. You see”&mdash;the trumpet
sounded again.</p>

<p>“I acknowledge I have been too hasty,” said Manfred.
“Father, do you go to the wicket, and demand who is at the
gate.”</p>

<p>“Do you grant me the life of Theodore?” replied the friar.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Manfred; “but inquire who is without.”</p>

<p>Jerome, falling on the neck of his son, discharged a flood of
tears, that spoke the fullness of his soul.</p>

<p>“You promised to go to the gate,” said Manfred.</p>

<p>“I thought,” replied the friar, “your highness would excuse
my thanking you first in this tribute of my heart.”</p>

<p>“Go, dearest sir,” said Theodore, “obey the prince; I do not
deserve that you should delay his satisfaction for me.”</p>

<p>Jerome, inquiring who was without, was answered, “A
herald.”</p>

<p>“From whom?” said he.</p>

<p>“From the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre,” said the herald;
“and I must speak with the usurper of Otranto.”</p>

<p>Jerome returned to the prince, and did not fail to repeat the
message in the very words it had been uttered. The first
sounds struck Manfred with terror; but when he heard himself
styled usurper, his rage rekindled, and all his courage revived.</p>

<p>“Usurper!&mdash;insolent villain!” cried he; “who dares to
question my title? Retire, father; this is no business for
monks: I will meet this presumptuous man myself. Go to
your convent, and prepare the princess’s return; your son
shall be a hostage for your fidelity: his life depends on your
obedience.”</p>

<p>“Good Heaven! my lord,” cried Jerome, “your highness
did but this instant freely pardon my child. Have you so soon
forgot the interposition of Heaven?”</p>

<p>“Heaven,” replied Manfred, “does not send heralds to
question the title of a lawful prince. I doubt whether it even
notifies its will through friars; but that is your affair, not
mine. At present you know my pleasure; and it is not a saucy
herald that shall save your son, if you do not return with the
princess.”</p>

<p>It was in vain for the holy man to reply. Manfred commanded
him to be conducted to the postern gate, and shut out
from the castle; and he ordered some of his attendants to carry
Theodore to the top of the Black Tower, and guard him strictly,
scarce permitting the father and son to exchange a hasty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
embrace at parting. He then withdrew to the hall, and seating
himself in princely state, ordered the herald to be admitted to
his presence.</p>

<p>“Well, thou insolent!” said the prince, “what wouldst thou
with me?”</p>

<p>“I come,” replied he, “to thee, Manfred, usurper of the
principality of Otranto, from the renowned and invincible
knight, the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre: in the name of his
lord, Frederic Marquis of Vicenza, he demands the Lady Isabella,
daughter of that prince, whom thou hast basely and traitorously
got into thy power, by bribing her false guardians during his
absence; and he requires thee to resign the principality of
Otranto, which thou hast usurped from the said Lord Frederic,
the nearest of blood to the last rightful lord, Alfonso the Good.
If thou dost not instantly comply with these just demands,
he defies thee to single combat to the last extremity.” And so
saying the herald cast down his warder.</p>

<p>“And where is this braggart who sends thee?” said Manfred.</p>

<p>“At the distance of a league,” said the herald: “he comes
to make good his lord’s claim against thee, as he is a true knight,
and thou an usurper and ravisher.”</p>

<p>Injurious as this challenge was, Manfred reflected that it was
not his interest to provoke the marquis. He knew how well
founded the claim of Frederic was, nor was this the first time
he had heard of it. Frederic’s ancestors had assumed the
style of Princes of Otranto, from the death of Alfonso the Good
without issue; but Manfred, his father, and grandfather, had
been too powerful for the house of Vicenza to dispossess them.
Frederic, a martial, amorous young prince, had married a
beautiful young lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who had
died in childbed of Isabella. Her death affected him so much,
that he had taken the cross and gone to the Holy Land, where
he was wounded in an engagement against the infidels, made
prisoner, and reported to be dead. When the news reached
Manfred’s ears, he bribed the guardians of the Lady Isabella to
deliver her up to him as a bride for his son Conrad, by which
alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the two houses.
This motive, on Conrad’s death, had co-operated to make him
so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself; and the same
reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the
consent of Frederic to this marriage. A like policy inspired
him with the thought of inviting Frederic’s champion into his
castle, lest he should be informed of Isabella’s flight, which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the
knight’s retinue.</p>

<p>“Herald,” said Manfred, as soon as he had digested these
reflections, “return to thy master, and tell him, ere we liquidate
our differences by the sword, Manfred would hold some converse
with him. Bid him welcome to my castle, where, by my faith,
as I am a true knight, he shall have courteous reception, and
full security for himself and followers. If we cannot adjust
our quarrel by amicable means, I swear he shall depart in
safety, and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of
arms. So help me God and his Holy Trinity!” The herald
made three obeisances, and retired.</p>

<p>During this interview, Jerome’s mind was agitated by a
thousand contrary passions. He trembled for the life of his
son, and his first thought was to persuade Isabella to return
to the castle. Yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of
her union with Manfred. He dreaded Hippolita’s unbounded
submission to the will of her lord; and though he did not doubt
but he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce, if he
could get access to her, yet, should Manfred discover that the
obstruction came from him, it might be equally fatal to Theodore.
He was impatient to know whence came the herald, who, with so
little management, had questioned the title of Manfred; yet he
did not dare absent himself from the convent, lest Isabella
should leave it, and her flight be imputed to him. He returned
disconsolately to the monastery, uncertain on what conduct to
resolve. A monk, who met him in the porch, and observed his
melancholy air, said, “Alas! brother, is it then true that we
have lost our excellent Princess Hippolita?”</p>

<p>The holy man started, and cried, “What meanest thou,
brother? I came this instant from the castle, and left her
in perfect health.”</p>

<p>“Martelli,” replied the other friar, “passed by the convent
but a quarter of an hour ago, on his way from the castle, and
reported that her highness was dead. All our brethren are
gone to the chapel to pray for her happy transit to a better
life, and willed me to wait thy arrival. They know thy holy
attachment to that good lady, and are anxious for the affliction
it will cause thee&mdash;indeed we have all reason to weep; she was
a mother to our house. But this life is but a pilgrimage;
we must not murmur&mdash;we shall all follow her: may our end
be like hers!”</p>

<p>“Good brother, thou dreamest,” said Jerome; “I tell thee I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
come from the castle, and left the princess well:&mdash;where is the
Lady Isabella?”</p>

<p>“Poor gentlewoman,” replied the friar, “I told her the sad
news, and offered her spiritual comfort; I reminded her of the
transitory condition of mortality, and advised her to take the
veil: I quoted the example of the holy Princess Sanchia of
Arragon.”</p>

<p>“Thy zeal was laudable,” said Jerome, impatiently; “but
at present it was unnecessary. Hippolita is well&mdash;at least I
trust in the Lord she is; I heard nothing to the contrary&mdash;yet
methinks, the prince’s earnestness&mdash;well, brother, but where is
the Lady Isabella?”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said the friar: “she wept much, and said she
would retire to her chamber.”</p>

<p>Jerome left his comrade abruptly, and hastened to the
princess, but she was not in her chamber. He inquired of
the domestics of the convent, but could learn no news of her.
He searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church,
and dispatched messengers round the neighbourhood, to get
intelligence if she had been seen, but to no purpose. Nothing
could equal the good man’s perplexity. He judged that Isabella,
suspecting Manfred of having precipitated his wife’s death, had
taken the alarm, and withdrawn herself to some more secret
place of concealment. This new flight would probably carry
the prince’s fury to the height. The report of Hippolita’s
death, though it seemed almost incredible, increased his consternation;
and though Isabella’s escape bespoke her aversion
of Manfred for a husband, Jerome could feel no comfort from
it while it endangered the life of his son. He determined to
return to the castle, and made several of his brethren accompany
him, to attest his innocence to Manfred, and, if necessary, join
their intercessions with his for Theodore.</p>

<p>The prince, in the meantime, had passed into the court, and
ordered the gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception
of the stranger knight and his train. In a few minutes the
cavalcade arrived. First came two harbingers with wands; next
a herald, followed by two pages and two trumpeters; then a
hundred foot-guards. These were attended by as many horse.
After them fifty footmen, clothed in scarlet and black, the
colours of the knight; then a led horse. Two heralds on each
side of a gentleman on horseback, bearing a banner, with the
arms of Vicenza and Otranto quarterly&mdash;a circumstance that
much offended Manfred, but he stifled his resentment. Two more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pages; the knight’s confessor telling his beads; fifty more footmen
clad as before; two knights habited in complete armour, their
beavers down, comrades to the principal knight; the squires of
the two knights, carrying their shields and devices; the knight’s
own squire; a hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword,
and seeming to faint under the weight of it. The knight himself,
on a chestnut steed, in complete armour, his lance in the
rest, his face entirely concealed by his visor, which was surmounted
by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers. Fifty
foot-guards, with drums and trumpets, closed the procession,
which wheeled off to the right and left, to make room for the
principal knight.</p>

<p>As soon as he approached the gate, he stopped; and the
herald, advancing, read again the words of the challenge. Manfred’s
eyes were fixed on the gigantic sword, and he scarce
seemed to attend to the cartel; but his attention was soon
diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him: he turned,
and beheld the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the
same extraordinary manner as before. It required intrepidity
like Manfred’s not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances
that seemed to announce his fate. Yet, scorning in the presence
of strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested,
he said boldly:</p>

<p>“Sir Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome. If thou
art of mortal mould, thy valour shall meet its equal; and if
thou art a true knight, thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to
carry thy point. Be these omens from heaven or hell, Manfred
trusts to the righteousness of his cause, and to the aid of St.
Nicholas, who has ever protected his house. Alight, Sir Knight,
and repose thyself; to-morrow thou shalt have a fair field; and
Heaven befriend the juster side!”</p>

<p>The knight made no reply, but, dismounting, was conducted
by Manfred to the great hall of the castle. As they traversed
the court, the knight stopped to gaze on the miraculous casque;
and, kneeling down, seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes.
Rising, he made a sign to the prince to lead on. As soon as
they entered the hall, Manfred proposed to the stranger to
disarm, but the knight shook his head in token of refusal. “Sir
Knight,” said Manfred, “this is not courteous: but by my
good faith I will not cross thee; nor shalt thou have cause to
complain of the Prince of Otranto. No treachery is designed
on my part; I hope none is intended on thine; here, take my
gage,” giving him his ring, “your friends and you shall enjoy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the laws of hospitality. Rest here until refreshments are
brought; I will but give orders for the accommodation of
your train, and return to you.”</p>

<p>The three knights bowed, as accepting his courtesy. Manfred
directed the stranger’s retinue to be conducted to an adjacent
hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception
of pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court to return
towards the gate, the gigantic sword burst from the supporters,
and falling to the ground opposite to the helmet, remained
immovable. Manfred, almost hardened to preternatural appearances,
surmounted the shock of this new prodigy; and
returning to the hall, where by this time the feast was ready,
he invited his silent guests to take their places. Manfred,
however ill his heart was at ease, endeavoured to inspire the
company with mirth. He put several questions to them, but
was answered only by signs. They raised their visors but
sufficiently to feed themselves, and that but sparingly.</p>

<p>“Sirs,” said the prince, “ye are the first guests I ever treated
within these walls, who scorned to hold any intercourse with
me; nor has it oft been customary, I ween, for princes to hazard
their state and dignity against strangers and mutes. You say
you come in the name of Frederic of Vicenza; I have ever heard
that he was a gallant and courteous knight; nor would he, I
am bold to say, think it beneath him to mix in social converse
with a prince who is his equal, and not unknown by deeds in
arms.&mdash;Still ye are silent&mdash;well, be it as it may, by the laws of
hospitality and chivalry, ye are masters under this roof: ye
shall do your pleasure&mdash;but come, give me a goblet of wine;
ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses.”
The principal knight sighed and crossed himself,
and was rising from the board. “Sir Knight,” said Manfred,
“what I said was but in sport; I shall constrain you in nothing.
Use your good liking; since mirth is not your mood, let us be
sad. Business may hit your fancies better; let us withdraw,
and hear if what I have to unfold may be better relished than
the vain efforts I have made for your pastime.”</p>

<p>Manfred then conducting the three knights into an inner
chamber, shut the door, and inviting them to be seated, began
thus, addressing himself to the chief personage:</p>

<p>“You come, Sir Knight, as I understand, in the name of
the Marquis of Vicenza, to re-demand the Lady Isabella, his
daughter, who has been contracted, in the face of Holy Church,
to my son, by the consent of her legal guardians; and to require<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
me to resign my dominions to your lord, who gives himself
for the nearest of blood to Prince Alfonso, whose soul God rest!
I shall speak to the latter article of your demands first. You
must know, your lord knows, that I enjoy the principality of
Otranto from my father Don Manuel, as he received it from his
father Don Ricardo. Alfonso, their predecessor, dying childless
in the Holy Land, bequeathed his estates to my grandfather,
Don Ricardo, in consideration of his faithful services.”&mdash;The
stranger shook his head.&mdash;“Sir Knight,” said Manfred,
warmly, “Ricardo was a valiant and upright man; he was a
pious man; witness his munificent foundation of the adjoining
church and two convents. He was peculiarly patronized by
St. Nicholas&mdash;my grandfather was incapable&mdash;I say, sir, Don
Ricardo was incapable&mdash;excuse me, your interruption has disordered
me.&mdash;I venerate the memory of my grandfather.&mdash;Well!
sirs, he held this estate; he held it by his good sword and by the
favour of St. Nicholas&mdash;so did my father; and so, sirs, will I,
come what come will.&mdash;But Frederic, your lord, is nearest in
blood.&mdash;I have consented to put my title to the issue of the
sword&mdash;does that imply a vicious title?&mdash;I might have asked,
where is Frederic, your lord? Report speaks him dead in captivity.
You say, your actions say, he lives&mdash;I question it not&mdash;I
might, sirs, I might, but I do not. Other princes would
bid Frederic take his inheritance by force, if he can: they
would not stake their dignity on a single combat: they would
not submit it to the decision of unknown mutes!&mdash;Pardon me,
gentlemen, I am too warm; but suppose yourselves in my
situation: as ye are stout knights, would it not move your
choler to have your own and the honour of your ancestors
called in question?&mdash;But to the point: ye require me to deliver
up the Lady Isabella.&mdash;Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorized to
receive her?”&mdash;The knight nodded.&mdash;“Receive her!” continued
Manfred; “well, you are authorized to receive her&mdash;but, gentle
knight, may I ask if you have full powers?”&mdash;The knight
nodded.&mdash;“’Tis well,” said Manfred. “Then hear what I have
to offer.&mdash;Ye see, gentlemen, before you the most unhappy of
men (he began to weep); afford me your compassion; I am
entitled to it; indeed I am. Know, I have lost my only hope,
my joy, the support of my house&mdash;Conrad died yester-morning.”&mdash;The
knights discovered signs of surprise.&mdash;“Yes, sirs, fate
has disposed of my son. Isabella is at liberty.”</p>

<p>“Do you then restore her?” cried the chief knight, breaking
silence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
“Afford me your patience,” said Manfred. “I rejoice to
find, by this testimony of your good will, that this matter may
be adjusted without bloodshed. It is no interest of mine
dictates what little I have farther to say. Ye behold in me a
man disgusted with the world; the loss of my son has weaned
me from earthly cares. Power and greatness have no longer
any charms in my eyes. I wished to transmit the sceptre I
had received from my ancestors with honour to my son&mdash;but
that is over! Life itself is so indifferent to me, that I accepted
your defiance with joy: a good knight cannot go to the grave
with more satisfaction than when falling in his vocation. Whatever
is the will of Heaven I submit; for, alas! sirs, I am a man
of many sorrows. Manfred is no object of envy&mdash;but no doubt
you are acquainted with my story.”&mdash;The knight made signs
of ignorance, and seemed curious to have Manfred proceed.&mdash;“Is
it possible, sirs,” continued the prince, “that my story
should be a secret to you? Have you heard nothing relating
to me and the Princess Hippolita?”&mdash;They shook their heads.&mdash;“No!
thus, then sirs, it is. You think me ambitious: ambition
alas! is composed of more rugged materials. If I were ambitious,
I should not for so many years have been a prey to all the hell
of conscientious scruples&mdash;but I weary your patience: I will
be brief. Know, then, that I have long been troubled in mind
on my union with the Princess Hippolita.&mdash;Oh, sirs, if ye were
acquainted with that excellent woman! if ye knew that I adore
her like a mistress, and cherish her as a friend&mdash;but man was not
born of perfect happiness! She shares my scruples, and with
her consent I have brought this matter before the Church, for
we are related within the forbidden degrees. I expect every
hour the definitive sentence that must separate us for ever&mdash;I
am sure you feel for me&mdash;I see you do&mdash;pardon these tears!”&mdash;The
knights gazed on each other, wondering where this would
end. Manfred continued:&mdash;“The death of my son betiding
while my soul was under this anxiety, I thought of nothing but
resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever from the sight of
mankind. My only difficulty was to fix on a successor, who
would be tender of my people, and to dispose of the Lady
Isabella, who is dear to me as my own blood. I was willing to
restore the line of Alfonso, even in his most distant kindred;
and though, pardon me, I am satisfied it was his will that
Ricardo’s lineage should take place of his own relations, yet
where was I to search for those relations? I knew of none but
Frederic, your lord: he was a captive to the infidels, or dead;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and were he living, and at home, would he quit the flourishing
state of Vicenza for the inconsiderable principality of Otranto?
If he would not, could I bear the thought of seeing a hard
unfeeling viceroy set over my poor faithful people?&mdash;for, sirs, I
love my people, and, thank Heaven, am beloved by them. But
ye will ask, whither tends this long discourse? briefly, then,
thus, sirs. Heaven in your arrival seems to point out a remedy
for these difficulties and my misfortunes. The Lady Isabella
is at liberty; I shall soon be so&mdash;I would submit to anything
for the good of my people&mdash;were it not the best, the only way
to extinguish the feuds between our families if I was to take
the Lady Isabella to wife&mdash;you start&mdash;but though Hippolita’s
virtues will ever be dear to me, a prince must not consider
himself; he is born for his people.”&mdash;A servant at that instant
entering the chamber, apprised Manfred that Jerome and
several of his brethren demanded immediate access to him.</p>

<p>The prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that
the friar would discover to the strangers that Isabella had taken
sanctuary, was going to forbid Jerome’s entrance. But recollecting
that he was certainly arrived to notify the princess’s
return, Manfred began to excuse himself to the knights for
leaving them for a few moments, but was prevented by the
arrival of the friars. Manfred angrily reprimanded them for
their intrusion, and would have forced them back from the
chamber; but Jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed.
He declared aloud the flight of Isabella, with protestations of
his own innocence. Manfred, distracted at the news, and not
less at its coming to the knowledge of the strangers, uttered
nothing but incoherent sentences, now upbraiding the friar,
now apologizing to the knights; earnest to know what was
become of Isabella, yet equally afraid of their knowing; impatient
to pursue her, yet dreading to have them join in the
pursuit. He offered to dispatch messengers in quest of her&mdash;but
the chief knight, no longer keeping silence, reproached Manfred
in bitter terms for his dark and ambiguous dealing, and demanded
the cause of Isabella’s first absence from the castle.
Manfred, casting a stern look at Jerome, implying a command
of silence, pretended that on Conrad’s death he had placed her
in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her.
Jerome, who trembled for his son’s life, did not dare contradict
this falsehood, but one of his brethren, not under the same
anxiety, declared frankly that she had fled to their church in
the preceding night. The prince in vain endeavoured to stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
this discovery, which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion.
The principal stranger, amazed at the contradictions
he heard, and more than half persuaded that Manfred had
secreted the princess, notwithstanding the concern he expressed
at her flight, rushing to the door, said,&mdash;“Thou traitor-prince!
Isabella shall be found.” Manfred endeavoured to hold him,
but the other knights assisting their comrade, he broke from the
prince, and hastened into the court, demanding his attendants.
Manfred, finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit, offered
to accompany him; and summoning his attendants, and taking
Jerome and some of the friars to guide them, they issued from
the castle; Manfred privately giving orders to have the knight’s
company secured, while to the knight he affected to dispatch
a messenger to require their assistance.</p>

<p>The company had no sooner quitted the castle, than Matilda,
who felt herself deeply interested for the young peasant, since
she had seen him condemned to death in the hall, and whose
thoughts had been taken up with concerting measures to save
him, was informed by some of the female attendants that
Manfred had dispatched all his men various ways in pursuit of
Isabella. He had in his hurry given this order in general
terms, not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon
Theodore, but forgetting it. The domestics, officious to obey
so peremptory a prince, and urged by their own curiosity and
love of novelty to join in any precipitate chase, had to a man
left the castle. Matilda disengaged herself from her women,
stole up to the Black Tower, and unbolting the door, presented
herself to the astonished Theodore. “Young man,” said she,
“though filial duty and womanly modesty condemn the step
I am taking, yet holy charity, surmounting all other ties,
justifies this act. Fly; the doors of thy prison are open; my
father and his domestics are absent; but they may soon return;
begone in safety; and may the angels of heaven direct thy
course!”</p>

<p>“Thou art surely one of those angels!” said the enraptured
Theodore: “none but a blessed saint could speak, could act,
could look like thee! May I not know the name of my divine
protectress? Methought thou namedst thy father: is it possible?
can Manfred’s blood feel holy pity? Lovely lady, thou answerest
not&mdash;but how art thou here thyself? why dost thou neglect thy
own safety, and waste a thought on a wretch like Theodore?
Let us fly together. The life thou bestowest shall be dedicated
to thy defence.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
“Alas! thou mistakest,” said Matilda, sighing: “I am Manfred’s
daughter, but no dangers await me.”</p>

<p>“Amazement!” said Theodore; “but last night I blessed
myself for yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion
so charitably returns me now.”</p>

<p>“Still thou art in error,” said the princess; “but this is no
time for explanation. Fly, virtuous youth, while it is in my
power to save thee. Should my father return, thou and I both
should indeed have cause to tremble.”</p>

<p>“How?” said Theodore, “thinkest thou, charming maid,
that I will accept of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to
thee? better I endure a thousand deaths.”</p>

<p>“I run no risk,” said Matilda, “but by thy delay. Depart;
it cannot be known that I assisted thy flight.”</p>

<p>“Swear by the saints above,” said Theodore, “that thou canst
not be suspected; else here I vow to wait whatever can befall me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thou art too generous,” said Matilda; “but rest assured
that no suspicion can alight on me.”</p>

<p>“Give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou dost not
deceive me,” said Theodore; “and let me bathe it with the
warm tears of gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Forbear,” said the princess; “this must not be.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Theodore, “I have never known but calamity
until this hour&mdash;perhaps shall never know other fortune again:
suffer the chaste raptures of holy gratitude: ’tis my soul would
print its effusions on thy hand.”</p>

<p>“Forbear, and be gone,” said Matilda; “how would Isabella
approve of seeing thee at my feet?”</p>

<p>“Who is Isabella?” said the young man with surprise.</p>

<p>“Ah me! I fear,” said the princess, “I am serving a deceitful
one;&mdash;hast thou forgot thy curiosity this morning?”</p>

<p>“Thy looks, thy actions, all thy beauteous self, seem an
emanation of divinity,” said Theodore; “but thy words are dark
and mysterious:&mdash;speak, lady; speak to thy servant’s comprehension.”</p>

<p>“Thou understandest but too well!” said Matilda. “But
once more, I command thee to be gone: thy blood, which I may
preserve, will be on my head, if I waste the time in vain
discourse.”</p>

<p>“I go, lady,” said Theodore, “because it is thy will, and
because I would not bring the grey hairs of my father with
sorrow to the grave. Say but, adored lady, that I have thy
gentle pity.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
“Stay,” said Matilda; “I will conduct thee to the subterraneous
vault by which Isabella escaped; it will lead thee to the
church of St. Nicholas, where thou mayest take sanctuary.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Theodore, “was it another, and not thy lovely
self, that I assisted to find the subterraneous passage?”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Matilda; “but ask no more; I tremble to see
thee still abide here: fly to the sanctuary.”</p>

<p>“To sanctuary!” said Theodore; “no, princess, sanctuaries
are for helpless damsels, or for criminals. Theodore’s soul is
free from guilt, nor will wear the appearance of it. Give me a
sword, lady, and thy father shall learn that Theodore scorns an
ignominious flight.”</p>

<p>“Rash youth!” said Matilda, “thou wouldst not dare to lift
thy presumptuous arm against the Prince of Otranto?”</p>

<p>“Not against thy father; indeed, I dare not,” said Theodore:
“excuse me, lady; I had forgotten&mdash;but could I gaze on thee,
and remember thou art sprung from the tyrant Manfred?&mdash;but
he is thy father, and from this moment my injuries are buried
in oblivion.” A deep and hollow groan, which seemed to come
from above, startled the princess and Theodore. “Good
Heavens! we are overheard!” said the princess. They listened,
but perceived no farther noise: they both concluded it the effect
of pent-up vapours. And the princess, preceding Theodore
softly, carried him to her father’s armoury, where equipping
him with a complete suit, he was conducted by Matilda to the
postern-gate.</p>

<p>“Avoid the town,” said the princess, “and all the western
side of the castle: ’tis there the search must be making by
Manfred and the strangers; but hie thee to the opposite quarter.
Yonder, behind that forest to the east, is a chain of rocks,
hollowed into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the sea-coast.
There thou mayest lie concealed till thou canst make
signs to some vessel to put on shore and take thee off. Go;
Heaven be thy guide!&mdash;and sometimes in thy prayers remember&mdash;Matilda!”
Theodore flung himself at her feet; and seizing
her lily hand, which with struggles she suffered him to kiss,
he vowed on the earliest opportunity to get himself knighted,
and fervently entreated her permission to swear himself eternally
her knight. Ere the princess could reply, a clap of thunder
was suddenly heard that shook the battlements. Theodore,
regardless of the tempest, would have urged his suit, but the
princess, dismayed, retreated hastily into the castle, and commanded
the youth to be gone with an air that would not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
disobeyed. He sighed and retired, but with eyes fixed on the
gate until Matilda, closing it, put an end to an interview in which
the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a passion, which both
now tasted for the first time.</p>

<p>Theodore went pensively to the convent, to acquaint his
father with his deliverance. There he learned the absence
of Jerome, and the pursuit that was making after the Lady
Isabella, with some particulars of whose story he now first
became acquainted. The generous gallantry of his nature
prompted him to wish to assist her; but the monks could lend
him no lights to guess at the route she had taken. He was
not tempted to wander far in search of her, for the idea of
Matilda had imprinted itself so strongly on his heart, that he
could not bear to absent himself at much distance from her
abode. The tenderness Jerome had expressed for him concurred
to confirm this reluctance; and he even persuaded himself
that filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering
between the castle and monastery, until Jerome should return
at night. Theodore at length determined to repair to the forest
that Matilda had pointed out to him. Arriving there, he sought
the gloomiest shades, as best suited to the pleasing melancholy
that reigned in his mind. In this mood he roved insensibly to
the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits,
and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil
spirits. He recollected to have heard this tradition; and being
of a brave and adventurous disposition, he willingly indulged
his curiosity in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth.
He had not penetrated far before he thought he heard the steps
of some person who seemed to retreat before him. Theodore,
though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be
believed, had no apprehension that good men were abandoned
without cause to the malice of the powers of darkness. He
thought the place more likely to be infested by robbers than
by those infernal agents who are reported to molest and bewilder
travellers. He had long burned with impatience to approve
his valour: drawing his sabre, he marched sedately onwards,
still directing his steps, as the imperfect rustling round before
him led the way. The armour he wore was a like indication
to the person who avoided him. Theodore, now convinced
that he was not mistaken, redoubled his pace, and evidently
gained on the person that fled, whose haste increasing, Theodore
came up just as a woman fell breathless before him. He
hasted to raise her; but her terror was so great that he apprehended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
she would faint in his arms. He used every gentle
word to dispel her alarms, and assured her that, far from injuring,
he would defend her at the peril of his life. The lady recovering
her spirits from his courteous demeanour, and gazing on her
protector, said, “Sure, I have heard that voice before!”</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge,” replied Theodore, “unless, as I
conjecture, thou art the Lady Isabella.”</p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven!” cried she, “thou art not sent in quest
of me, art thou?” And saying these words she threw herself
at his feet, and besought him not to deliver her up to Manfred.</p>

<p>“To Manfred!” cried Theodore; “no, lady, I have once already
delivered thee from his tyranny, and it shall fare hard with me
now, but I will place thee out of the reach of his daring.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” said she, “that thou shouldst be the generous
unknown whom I met last night in the vault of the castle?
Sure thou art not a mortal, but my guardian angel. On my
knees let me thank&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold, gentle princess,” said Theodore, “nor demean thyself
before a poor and friendless young man. If Heaven has selected
me for thy deliverer, it will accomplish its work, and strengthen
my arm in thy cause: but come, lady, we are too near the mouth
of the cavern; let us seek its inmost recesses; I can have
no tranquillity till I have placed thee beyond the reach of
danger.”</p>

<p>“Alas, what mean you, sir?” said she. “Though all your
actions are noble, though your sentiments speak the purity of
your soul, is it fitting that I should accompany you alone in
these perplexed retreats? should we be found together, what
would a censorious world think of my conduct?”</p>

<p>“I respect your virtuous delicacy,” said Theodore; “nor
do you harbour a suspicion that wounds my honour. I meant
to conduct you into the most private cavity of these rocks,
and then, at the hazard of my life, to guard their entrance
against every living thing. Besides, lady,” continued he,
drawing a deep sigh, “beauteous and all perfect as your form
is, and though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring, know,
my soul is dedicated to another; and although&mdash;&mdash;” A sudden
noise prevented Theodore from proceeding. They soon distinguished
these sounds, “Isabella! what ho! Isabella!”</p>

<p>The trembling princess relapsed into her former agony of
fear. Theodore endeavoured to encourage her, but in vain.
He assured her he would rather die than suffer her to return
under Manfred’s power, and begging her to remain concealed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
he went forth to prevent the person in search of her from
approaching.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the cavern he found an armed knight discoursing
with a peasant, who assured him he had seen a lady
enter the passes of the rock. The knight was preparing to seek
her, when Theodore, placing himself in his way, with his sword
drawn, sternly forbade him at his peril to advance.</p>

<p>“And who art thou who darest to cross my way?” said the
knight haughtily.</p>

<p>“One who does not dare more than he will perform,” said
Theodore.</p>

<p>“I seek the Lady Isabella,” said the knight, “and understand
she has taken refuge among these rocks. Impede me not, or
thou wilt repent having provoked my resentment.”</p>

<p>“Thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible,”
said Theodore: “return whence thou camest, or we shall soon
know whose resentment is most terrible.”</p>

<p>The stranger, who was the principal knight that had arrived
from the Marquis of Vicenza, had galloped from Manfred as he
was busied in getting information of the princess, and giving
various orders to prevent her falling into the power of the three
knights. Their chief had suspected Manfred of being privy to
the princess’s absconding; and this insult from a man who, he
concluded, was stationed by that prince to secrete her, confirming
his suspicions, he made no reply, but discharging a
blow with his sabre at Theodore, would soon have removed all
obstruction, if Theodore, who took him for one of Manfred’s
captains, and who had no sooner given the provocation than
he prepared to support it, had not received the stroke on his
shield. The valour that had so long been smothered in his
breast broke forth at once; he rushed impetuously on the knight,
whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to
hardy deeds. The combat was furious, but not long: Theodore
wounded the knight in three several places, and at last disarmed
him, as he fainted by the loss of blood. The peasant,
who had fled on the first onset, had given the alarm to some of
Manfred’s domestics, who, by his orders, were dispersed through
the forest in pursuit of Isabella. They came up as the knight
fell, whom they soon discovered to be the noble stranger.
Theodore, notwithstanding his hatred to Manfred, could not
behold the victory he had gained without emotions of pity and
generosity. But he was more touched when he learned the
quality of his adversary, and was informed that he was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
retainer, but an enemy of Manfred. He assisted the servants
of the latter in disarming the knight, and in endeavouring to
stanch the blood that flowed from his wounds. The knight
recovering his speech, said, in a faint and faltering voice,
“Generous foe, we have both been in an error: I took thee for
an instrument of the tyrant: I perceive thou hast made the
like mistake: it is too late for excuses&mdash;I faint&mdash;if Isabella is at
hand, call her; I have important secrets to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is dying,” said one of the attendants; “has nobody a
crucifix about them? Andrea, do thou pray over him.”</p>

<p>“Fetch some water,” said Theodore, “and pour it down his
throat, while I hasten to the princess.” Saying this, he flew to
Isabella, and in few words told her modestly, that he had been
so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from her
father’s court, who wished, ere he died, to impart something of
consequence to her. The princess, who had been transported
at hearing the voice of Theodore, as he called to her to come
forth, was astonished at what she heard. Suffering herself to
be conducted by Theodore, the new proof of whose valour
recalled her dispersed spirits, she came where the bleeding
knight lay speechless on the ground&mdash;but her fears returned
when she beheld the domestics of Manfred. She would again
have fled, if Theodore had not made her observe that they were
unarmed, and had not threatened them with instant death if
they should dare to seize the princess. The stranger, opening his
eyes, and beholding a woman, said, “Art thou&mdash;pray tell me
truly&mdash;art thou Isabella of Vicenza?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said she. “Good Heaven restore thee!”</p>

<p>“Then thou&mdash;&mdash;then thou&mdash;&mdash;” said the knight, struggling
for utterance, “seest&mdash;thy father. Give me one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, amazement! horror! what do I hear? what do I see?”
cried Isabella. “My father! you my father! how came you
here, sir? for Heaven’s sake speak!&mdash;Oh, run for help, or he
will expire!”</p>

<p>“’Tis most true,” said the wounded knight, exerting all his
force; “I am Frederic thy father&mdash;yes, I came to deliver thee&mdash;it
will not be&mdash;give me a parting kiss, and take&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Theodore, “do not exhaust yourself: suffer us to
convey you to the castle.”</p>

<p>“To the castle!” said Isabella; “is there no help nearer than
the castle? would you expose my father to the tyrant? if he goes
thither, I cannot accompany him&mdash;and yet, can I leave him?”</p>

<p>“My child,” said Frederic, “it matters not to me whither I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
carried: a few minutes will place me beyond danger&mdash;but while
I have eyes to dote on thee, forsake me not, dear Isabella!
This brave knight, I know not who he is, will protect thy
innocence.&mdash;Sir, you will not abandon my child, will you?”</p>

<p>Theodore, shedding tears over his victim, and vowing to guard
the princess at the expense of his life, persuaded Frederic to
suffer himself to be conducted to the castle. They placed him
on a horse belonging to one of the domestics, after binding up
his wounds as well as they were able. Theodore marched by his
side, and the afflicted Isabella, who could not bear to quit him,
followed mournfully behind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>The sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle than they
were met by Hippolita and Matilda, whom Isabella had sent one
of the domestics before to advertise of their approach. The
ladies, causing Frederic to be conveyed into the nearest chamber,
retired, while the surgeons examined his wounds. Matilda
blushed at seeing Theodore and Isabella together; but endeavoured
to conceal it by embracing the latter, and condoling with
her on her father’s mischance. The surgeons soon came to
acquaint Hippolita that none of the marquis’s wounds were
dangerous, and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter and
the princesses. Theodore, under pretence of expressing his
joy at being freed from his apprehensions of the combat being
fatal to Frederic, could not resist the impulse of following
Matilda. Her eyes were so often cast down on meeting his, that
Isabella, who regarded Theodore as attentively as he gazed on
Matilda, soon divined who the object was that he had told her
in the cave engaged his affections. While this mute scene
passed, Hippolita demanded of Frederic the cause of his having
taken that mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter; and
threw in various apologies to excuse her lord for the match
contracted between their children. Frederic, however incensed
against Manfred, was not insensible to the courtesy and benevolence
of Hippolita; but he was still more struck with the lovely
form of Matilda. Wishing to detain them by his bedside, he
informed Hippolita of his story. He told her, that, while
prisoner to the infidel, he had dreamed that his daughter, of
whom he had learned no news since his captivity, was detained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in a castle, where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes;
and that if he obtained his liberty, and repaired to a
wood near Joppa, he would learn more. Alarmed at this dream,
and incapable of obeying the direction given by it, his chains
became more grievous than ever. But while his thoughts were
occupied on the means of obtaining his liberty, he received the
agreeable news that the confederate princes, who were warring
in Palestine, had paid his ransom. He instantly set out for the
wood that had been marked in his dream. For three days he
and his attendants had wandered in the forest without seeing
a human form; but on the evening of the third they came to a
cell, in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of
death. Applying rich cordials, they brought the saint-like
man to his speech. “My sons,” said he, “I am bounden to your
charity&mdash;but it is in vain&mdash;I am going to my eternal rest&mdash;yet I
die with the satisfaction of performing the will of Heaven.
When first I repaired to this solitude, after seeing my country
become a prey to unbelievers&mdash;it is, alas! above fifty years since
I was witness to that dreadful scene&mdash;St. Nicholas appeared to
me, and revealed a secret, which he bade me never disclose to
mortal man, but on my death-bed. This is that tremendous
hour, and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors to whom I was
ordered to reveal my trust. As soon as ye have done the last
offices to this wretched corse, dig under the seventh tree on the
left hand of this poor cave, and your pains will&mdash;&mdash; Oh, good
Heaven, receive my soul!” With those words the devout man
breathed his last.</p>

<p>“By break of day,” continued Frederic, “when we had
committed the holy relics to earth, we dug according to direction;
but what was our astonishment, when, about the depth
of six feet, we discovered an enormous sabre&mdash;the very weapon
yonder in the court. On the blade, which was then partly out
of the scabbard, though since closed by our efforts in removing
it, were written the following lines&mdash;no; excuse me, madam,”
added the marquis, turning to Hippolita, “if I forbear to repeat
them: I respect your sex and rank, and would not be guilty of
offending your ear with sounds injurious to aught that is dear
to you.”</p>

<p>He paused&mdash;Hippolita trembled. She did not doubt but
Frederic was destined by Heaven to accomplish the fate
that seemed to threaten her house. Looking with anxious
fondness at Matilda, a silent tear stole down her cheek;
but recollecting herself, she said, “Proceed, my lord, Heaven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
does nothing in vain; mortals must receive its divine behests
with lowliness and submission. It is our part to deprecate its
wrath, or bow to its decrees. Repeat the sentence, my lord;
we listen resigned.”</p>

<p>Frederic was grieved that he had proceeded so far. The
dignity and patient firmness of Hippolita penetrated him with
respect; and the tender, silent affection with which the princess
and her daughter regarded each other melted him almost to
tears. Yet apprehensive that his forbearance to obey would
be more alarming, he repeated, in a faltering and low voice,
the following lines:</p>

<table><tr><td><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where’er a casque that suits this sword is found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With perils is thy daughter compass’d round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alfonso’s blood alone can save the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quiet a long-restless prince’s shade.<br /></span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>“What is there in these lines,” said Theodore, impatiently,
“that affects these princesses? Why were they to be shocked
by a mysterious delicacy, that has so little foundation?”</p>

<p>“Your words are rude, young man,” said the marquis; “and
though fortune has favoured you once&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My honoured lord,” said Isabella, who resented Theodore’s
warmth, which she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for
Matilda, “discompose not yourself for the glozing of a peasant’s
son: he forgets the reverence he owes you; but he is not
accustomed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Hippolita, concerned at the heat that had arisen, checked
Theodore for his boldness, but with an air acknowledging his
zeal; and changing the conversation, demanded of Frederic
where he had left her lord?</p>

<p>As the marquis was going to reply, they heard a noise without,
and rising to inquire the cause, Manfred, Jerome, and part of
the troop, who had met an imperfect rumour of what had
happened, entered the chamber. Manfred advanced hastily
towards Frederic’s bed to condole with him on his misfortune,
and to learn the circumstances of the combat, when, starting
in an agony of terror and amazement, he cried:</p>

<p>“Ah! what art thou? Thou dreadful spectre! Is my hour
come?”</p>

<p>“My dearest, gracious lord,” cried Hippolita, clasping him
in her arms, “what is it you see? Why do you fix your eyeballs
thus?”</p>

<p>“What,” cried Manfred, breathless, “dost thou see nothing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Hippolita? Is this ghastly phantom sent to me alone&mdash;to me,
who did not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sweetest self, my lord,” said Hippolita, “resume
your soul, command your reason; there are none here, but us,
your friends.”</p>

<p>“What, is not that Alfonso?” cried Manfred; “dost thou not
see him? Can it be my brain’s delirium?”</p>

<p>“This! my lord,” said Hippolita: “this is Theodore, the youth
who has been so unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“Theodore,” said Manfred mournfully, and striking his forehead&mdash;“Theodore,
or a phantom, he has unhinged the soul of
Manfred. But how comes he here? and how comes he in
armour?”</p>

<p>“I believe he went in search of Isabella,” said Hippolita.</p>

<p>“Of Isabella,” said Manfred, relapsing into rage. “Yes, yes,
that is not doubtful&mdash;but how did he escape from durance, in
which I left him? Was it Isabella, or this hypocritical old friar,
that procured his enlargement?”</p>

<p>“And would a parent be criminal, my lord,” said Theodore,
“if he meditated the deliverance of his child?”</p>

<p>Jerome, amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his
son, and without foundation, knew not what to think. He
could not comprehend how Theodore had escaped&mdash;how he
came to be armed, and to encounter Frederic. Still he would
not venture to ask any questions that might tend to inflame
Manfred’s wrath against his son. Jerome’s silence convinced
Manfred that he had contrived Theodore’s release.</p>

<p>“And is it thus, thou ungrateful old man,” said the prince,
addressing himself to the friar, “that thou repayest mine and
Hippolita’s bounties? And not content with traversing my
heart’s nearest wishes, thou armest thy bastard, and bringest
him into my own castle to insult me!”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Theodore, “you wrong my father: nor he nor
I are capable of harbouring a thought against your peace. Is it
insolence thus to surrender myself to your highness’s pleasure?”
added he, laying his sword respectfully at Manfred’s feet.
“Behold my bosom; strike, my lord, if you suspect that a disloyal
thought is lodged there. There is not a sentiment engraven
on my heart that does not venerate you and yours.”</p>

<p>The grace and fervour with which Theodore uttered these
words interested every person present in his favour. Even
Manfred was touched; yet still possessed with his resemblance
to Alfonso, his admiration was dashed with secret horror.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
“Rise,” said he; “thy life is not my present purpose. But
tell me thy history, and how thou camest connected with this
old traitor here.”</p>

<p>“My lord&mdash;&mdash;” said Jerome, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Peace! impostor,” said Manfred; “I will not have him
prompted.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Theodore, “I want no assistance: my story
is very brief. I was carried at five years of age to Algiers with
my mother, who had been taken by corsairs from the coast of
Sicily. She died of grief in less than a twelvemonth.” The
tears gushed from Jerome’s eyes, on whose countenance a
thousand anxious passions stood expressed. “Before she
died,” continued Theodore, “she bound a writing about my
arm under my garments, which told me I was the son of the
Count Falconara.”</p>

<p>“It is most true,” said Jerome; “I am that wretched father.”</p>

<p>“Again I enjoin thee silence,” said Manfred. “Proceed.”</p>

<p>“I remained in slavery,” said Theodore, “until within these
two years; when, attending on my master in his cruises, I
was delivered by a Christian vessel which overpowered the
pirate; and discovering myself to the captain, he generously
put me on shore in Sicily:&mdash;but, alas! instead of finding a
father, I learned that his estate, which was situated on the
coast, had, during his absence, been laid waste by the rover,
who had carried my mother and me into captivity; that his
castle had been burnt to the ground, and that my father, on his
return, had sold what remained, and was retired into religion
in the kingdom of Naples, but where, no man could inform me.
Destitute and friendless, hopeless almost of attaining the transport
of a parent’s embrace, I took the first opportunity of setting
sail for Naples; from whence, within these six days, I wandered
into this province, still supporting myself by the labour of my
hands: nor until yester-morn did I believe that Heaven had
reserved any lot for me but peace of mind and contented
poverty. This, my lord, is Theodore’s story. I am blessed
beyond my hope in finding a father; I am unfortunate beyond
my desert in having incurred your highness’s displeasure.”</p>

<p>He ceased. A murmur of approbation gently arose from the
audience.</p>

<p>“This is not all,” said Frederic: “I am bound in honour to
add what he suppresses. Though he is modest, I must be
generous&mdash;he is one of the bravest youths on Christian ground.
He is warm too; and from the short knowledge I have of him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
I will pledge myself for his veracity; if what he reports of himself
were not true, he would not utter it.&mdash;And for me, youth,
I honour a frankness which becomes thy birth. But now, and
thou didst offend me; yet the noble blood which flows in thy
veins may well be allowed to boil out, when it has so recently
traced itself to its source.&mdash;Come, my lord,” turning to Manfred,
“if I can pardon him, surely you may: it is not the youth’s
fault, if you took him for a spectre.”</p>

<p>This bitter taunt galled the soul of Manfred. “If beings
from another world,” replied he haughtily, “have power to
impress my mind with awe, it is more than living man can do:
nor could a stripling’s arm&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My lord,” interrupted Hippolita, “your guest has occasion
for repose: shall we not leave him to his rest?” Saying this,
and taking Manfred by the hand, she took leave of Frederic,
and led the company forth. The prince, not sorry to quit a
conversation which recalled to mind the discovery he had made
of his most secret sensations, suffered himself to be conducted
to his own apartment, after permitting Theodore, though under
engagement to return to the castle on the morrow (a condition
the young man gladly accepted), to retire with his father to
the convent. Matilda and Isabella were too much occupied
with their own reflections, and too little content with each
other, to wish for farther converse that night. They separated,
each to her chamber, with more expressions of ceremony and
fewer of affection than had passed between them since their
childhood.</p>

<p>If they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with
greater impatience, as soon as the sun was risen. Their minds
were in a situation that excluded sleep, and each recollected a
thousand questions which she wished she had put to the other
overnight. Matilda reflected that Isabella had been twice
delivered by Theodore in very critical situations, which she
could not believe accidental. His eyes, it was true, had been
fixed on her in Frederic’s chamber; but that might have been
to disguise his passion for Isabella from the fathers of both.
It were better to clear this up. She wished to know the truth,
lest she should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion
for Isabella’s lover. Thus jealousy prompted, and at the
same time borrowed, an excuse from friendship to justify its
curiosity.</p>

<p>Isabella, not less restless, had better foundation for her
suspicions. Both Theodore’s tongue and eyes had told her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
his heart was engaged&mdash;it was true&mdash;yet perhaps Matilda
might not correspond to his passion; she had ever appeared
insensible to love: all her thoughts were set on heaven. “Why
did I dissuade her?” said Isabella to herself: “I am punished
for my generosity; but when did they meet? where? It cannot
be. I have deceived myself; perhaps last night was the first
time they beheld each other; it must be some other object
that has prepossessed his affections. If it is, I am not so unhappy
as I thought; if it is not my friend Matilda&mdash;how! can
I stoop to wish for the affection of a man who rudely and unnecessarily
acquainted me with his indifference? and that at
the very moment in which common courtesy demanded at least
expressions of civility? I will go to my dear Matilda, who will
confirm me in this becoming pride&mdash;man is false&mdash;I will advise
with her on taking the veil: she will rejoice to find me in this
disposition; and I will acquaint her that I no longer oppose
her inclination for the cloister.” In this frame of mind, and
determined to open her heart entirely to Matilda, she went to
that princess’s chamber, whom she found already dressed, and
leaning pensively on her arm. This attitude, so correspondent
to what she felt herself, revived Isabella’s suspicions, and
destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend.
They blushed at meeting, and were too much novices to disguise
their sensations with address. After some unmeaning questions
and replies, Matilda demanded of Isabella the cause of her
flight. The latter, who had almost forgotten Manfred’s
passion, so entirely was she occupied by her own, concluding
that Matilda referred to her last escape from the convent, which
had occasioned the events of the preceding evening, replied,
“Martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was
dead&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Matilda, interrupting her, “Bianca has explained
that mistake to me: on seeing me faint, she cried, ‘The princess
is dead’; and Martelli, who had come for the usual dole to
the castle&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what made you faint?” said Isabella, indifferent to
the rest.</p>

<p>Matilda blushed, and stammered, “My father&mdash;he was
sitting in judgment on a criminal.”</p>

<p>“What criminal?” said Isabella, eagerly.</p>

<p>“A young man,” said Matilda:&mdash;“I believe&mdash;I think it was
that young man that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What, Theodore?” said Isabella.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
“Yes,” answered she; “I never saw him before; I do not know
how he had offended my father&mdash;but as he has been of service
to you, I am glad my lord has pardoned him.”</p>

<p>“Served me!” replied Isabella; “do you term it serving me,
to wound my father, and almost occasion his death? Though
it is but since yesterday that I am blessed with knowing a
parent, I hope Matilda does not think I am such a stranger to
filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness of that audacious
youth, and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any affection
for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my being.
No, Matilda, my heart abhors him; and if you still retain the
friendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy, you
will detest the man who has been on the point of making me
miserable for ever.”</p>

<p>Matilda held down her head, and replied, “I hope my dearest
Isabella does not doubt her Matilda’s friendship: I never beheld
that youth until yesterday; he is almost a stranger to me:
but as the surgeons have pronounced your father out of danger,
you ought not to harbour uncharitable resentment against one,
who, I am persuaded, did not know the marquis was related
to you.”</p>

<p>“You plead his cause very pathetically,” said Isabella,
“considering he is so much a stranger to you! I am mistaken,
or he returns your charity.”</p>

<p>“What mean you?” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Isabella, repenting that she had given Matilda
a hint of Theodore’s inclination for her. Then, changing the
discourse, she asked Matilda what occasioned Manfred to take
Theodore for a spectre?</p>

<p>“Bless me,” said Matilda, “did you not observe his extreme
resemblance to the portrait of Alfonso in the gallery? I took
notice of it to Bianca even before I saw him in armour; but with
the helmet on he is the very image of that picture.”</p>

<p>“I do not much observe pictures,” said Isabella: “much less
have I examined this young man so attentively as you seem
to have done. Ah, Matilda, your heart is in danger; but let
me warn you as a friend&mdash;he has owned to me that he is in love;
it cannot be with you, for yesterday was the first time you ever
met&mdash;was it not?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Matilda; “but why does my dearest
Isabella conclude from anything I have said, that”&mdash;she
paused&mdash;then continuing: “he saw you first, and I am far from
having the vanity to think that my little portion of charms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
could engage a heart devoted to you&mdash;may you be happy,
Isabella, whatever is the fate of Matilda!”</p>

<p>“My lovely friend,” said Isabella, whose heart was too honest
to resist a kind expression, “it is you that Theodore admires;
I saw it; I am persuaded of it; nor shall a thought of my own
happiness suffer me to interfere with yours.” This frankness
drew tears from the gentle Matilda; and jealousy, that for a
moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens,
soon gave way to the natural sincerity and candour of their
souls. Each confessed to the other the impression that Theodore
had made on her; and this confidence was followed by a struggle
of generosity, each insisting on yielding her claim to her friend.
At length the dignity of Isabella’s virtue reminding her of the
preference which Theodore had almost declared for her rival,
made her determine to conquer her passion, and cede the beloved
object to her friend.</p>

<p>During this contest of amity, Hippolita entered her daughter’s
chamber.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said she to Isabella, “you have so much tenderness
for Matilda, and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects
our wretched house, that I can have no secrets with my child
which are not proper for you to hear.” The princesses were all
attention and anxiety.</p>

<p>“Know then, madam,” continued Hippolita, “and you, my
dearest Matilda, that being convinced by all the events of these
two last ominous days that Heaven purposes the sceptre of
Otranto should pass from Manfred’s hands into those of the
Marquis Frederic; I have been perhaps inspired with the thought
of averting our total destruction by the union of our rival houses.
With this view I have been proposing to Manfred, my lord, to
tender this dear, dear child to Frederic your father.”</p>

<p>“Me to Lord Frederic!” cried Matilda. “Good heavens! my
gracious mother, and have you named it to my father?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said Hippolita: “he listened benignly to my
proposal, and is gone to break it to the marquis.”</p>

<p>“Ah! wretched princess,” cried Isabella, “what hast thou
done? what ruin has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing
for thyself, for me, and for Matilda!”</p>

<p>“Ruin from me, to you, and to my child!” said Hippolita;
“what can this mean?”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Isabella, “the purity of your own heart prevents
your seeing the depravity of others. Manfred, your lord, that
impious man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
“Hold!” said Hippolita, “you must not, in my presence,
young lady, mention Manfred with disrespect; he is my lord and
husband, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will not long be so,” said Isabella, “if his wicked purposes
can be carried into execution.”</p>

<p>“This language amazes me,” said Hippolita. “Your feeling,
Isabella, is warm: but until this hour I never knew it betray
you into intemperance. What deed of Manfred authorizes you
to treat him as a murderer, an assassin?”</p>

<p>“Thou virtuous, and too credulous princess!” replied Isabella;
“it is not thy life he aims at&mdash;it is to separate himself from
thee! to divorce thee! to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To divorce me!”&mdash;“To divorce my mother!” cried Hippolita
and Matilda at once.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Isabella; “and, to complete his crime, he meditates&mdash;I
cannot speak it!”</p>

<p>“What can surpass what thou hast already uttered?” said
Matilda.</p>

<p>Hippolita was silent. Grief choked her speech; and the
recollection of Manfred’s late ambiguous discourses confirmed
what she heard.</p>

<p>“Excellent, dear lady!&mdash;madam! mother!” cried Isabella,
flinging herself at Hippolita’s feet in a transport of passion;
“trust me, believe me, I will die a thousand deaths
sooner than consent to injure you, than yield to so
odious&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is too much!” cried Hippolita. “What crimes
does one crime suggest! Rise, dear Isabella; I do not doubt
your virtue. Oh, Matilda, this stroke is too heavy for thee! weep
not, my child; and not a murmur, I charge thee. Remember,
he is <i>thy</i> father still!”</p>

<p>“But you are my mother, too,” said Matilda, fervently;
“and <i>you</i> are virtuous, <i>you</i> are guiltless! Oh, must not I,
must not I complain?”</p>

<p>“You must not,” said Hippolita; “come, all will be well.
Manfred, in the agony for the loss of thy brother, knew not
what he said; perhaps Isabella misunderstood him: his heart is
good&mdash;and, my child, thou knowest not all. There is a destiny
hangs over us: the hand of Providence is stretched out. Oh,
could I but save thee from the wreck.&mdash;Yes,” continued she, in
a firmer tone, “perhaps the sacrifice of myself may atone for
all; I will go and offer myself to this divorce&mdash;it boots not
what becomes of me. I will withdraw into the neighbouring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
monastery, and waste the remainder of life in prayers and
tears for my child and&mdash;the prince.”</p>

<p>“Thou art as much too good for this world,” said Isabella,
“as Manfred is execrable&mdash;but think not, lady, that thy weakness
shall determine for me. I swear, hear me all ye angels&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop, I adjure thee,” cried Hippolita: “remember thou
dost not depend on thyself; thou hast a father&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My father is too pious, too noble,” interrupted Isabella,
“to command an impious deed. But should he command it;
can a father enjoin a cursed act? I was contracted to the
son, can I wed the father?&mdash;No, madam, no; force should not
drag me to Manfred’s hated bed. I loathe him, I abhor him:
divine and human laws forbid; and, my friend, my dearest
Matilda, would I wound her tender soul by injuring her adored
mother? my own mother&mdash;I never have known another.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is the mother of both,” cried Matilda: “can we,
can we, Isabella, adore her too much?”</p>

<p>“My lovely children,” said the touched Hippolita, “your
tenderness overpowers me; but I must not give way to it. It
is not ours to make election for ourselves; Heaven, our fathers,
and our husbands, must decide for us. Have patience until
you hear what Manfred and Frederic have determined. If the
marquis accepts Matilda’s hand, I know she will readily obey.
Heaven may interpose and prevent the rest. What means my
child?” continued she, seeing Matilda fall at her feet with a
flood of speechless tears.&mdash;“But no; answer me not, my daughter;
I must not hear a word against the pleasure of thy father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, doubt not my obedience, my dreadful obedience to him
and to you!” said Matilda. “But can I, most respected of
women, can I experience all this tenderness, this world of
goodness, and conceal a thought from the best of mothers?”</p>

<p>“What art thou going to utter?” said Isabella, trembling.
“Recollect thyself, Matilda.”</p>

<p>“No, Isabella,” said the princess, “I should not deserve this
incomparable parent, if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured
a thought without her permission&mdash;nay, I have offended her;
I have suffered a passion to enter my heart without her
avowal; but here I disclaim it; here I vow to Heaven and
her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My child! my child!” said Hippolita, “what words are
these? what new calamities has fate in store for us? Thou, a
passion! Thou, in this hour of destruction!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see all my guilt,” said Matilda. “I abhor myself, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
I cost my mother a pang: she is the dearest thing I have on
earth. Oh, I will never, never behold him more!”</p>

<p>“Isabella,” said Hippolita, “thou art conscious to this
unhappy secret, whatever it is. Speak!”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Matilda, “have I so forfeited my mother’s
love, that she will not permit me even to speak my own guilt?
Oh, wretched, wretched Matilda!”</p>

<p>“Thou art too cruel,” said Isabella to Hippolita; “canst thou
behold this anguish of a virtuous mind, and not commiserate
it?”</p>

<p>“Not pity my child!” said Hippolita, catching Matilda in
her arms. “Oh, I know she is good; she is all virtue, all
tenderness and duty. I do forgive thee, my excellent, my
only hope!”</p>

<p>The princesses then revealed to Hippolita their mutual
inclination for Theodore, and the purpose of Isabella to resign
him to Matilda. Hippolita blamed their imprudence, and
showed them the improbability that either father would consent
to bestow his heiress on so poor a man, though nobly
born. Some comfort it gave her to find their passion of so
recent a date, and that Theodore had had but little cause to
suspect it in either. She strictly enjoined them to avoid all
correspondence with him. This Matilda fervently promised;
but Isabella, who flattered herself that she meant no more than
to promote his union with her friend, could not determine to
avoid him, and made no reply.</p>

<p>“I will go to the convent,” said Hippolita, “and order new
masses to be said for a deliverance from these calamities.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my mother,” said Matilda, “you mean to quit us: you
mean to take sanctuary, and to give my father an opportunity
of pursuing his fatal intentions. Alas! on my knees I supplicate
you to forbear: will you leave me a prey to Frederic? I will
follow you to the convent.”</p>

<p>“Be at peace, my child,” said Hippolita; “I will return
instantly. I will never abandon thee, until I know it is the
will of Heaven, and for thy benefit.”</p>

<p>“Do not deceive me,” said Matilda. “I will not marry
Frederic until thou commandest it. Alas! what will become
of me?”</p>

<p>“Why that exclamation?” said Hippolita. “I have promised
thee to return.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my mother,” replied Matilda; “stay and save me
from myself. A frown from thee can do more than all my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
father’s severity. I have given away my heart, and you alone
can make me recall it.”</p>

<p>“No more,” said Hippolita: “thou must not relapse, Matilda.”</p>

<p>“I can quit Theodore,” said she, “but must I wed another?
Let me attend thee to the altar, and shut myself from the
world for ever.”</p>

<p>“Thy fate depends on thy father,” said Hippolita: “I have
ill bestowed my tenderness, if it has taught thee to revere
aught beyond him. Adieu! my child, I go to pray for
thee.”</p>

<p>Hippolita’s real purpose was to demand of Jerome, whether
in conscience she might not consent to the divorce. She had
oft urged Manfred to resign the principality, which the delicacy
of her conscience rendered an hourly burden to her. These
scruples concurred to make the separation from her husband
appear less dreadful to her, than it would have seemed in
any other situation.</p>

<p>Jerome, at quitting the castle overnight, had questioned
Theodore severely why he had accused him to Manfred of being
privy to his escape. Theodore owned it had been with design
to prevent Manfred’s suspicion from alighting on Matilda; and
added, the holiness of Jerome’s life and character secured him
from the tyrant’s wrath. Jerome was heartily grieved to discover
his son’s inclination for that princess; and leaving him
to his rest, promised in the morning to acquaint him with
important reasons for conquering his passion. Theodore, like
Isabella, was too recently acquainted with parental authority
to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart. He
had little curiosity to learn the friar’s reasons, and less disposition
to obey them. The lovely Matilda had made stronger
impressions on him than filial affection. All night he pleased
himself with visions of love; and it was not till late after the
morning office that he recollected the friar’s commands to
attend him at Alfonso’s tomb.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said Jerome, when he saw him, “this tardiness
does not please me. Have a father’s commands already so
little weight?”</p>

<p>Theodore made awkward excuses, and attributed his delay
to having overslept himself.</p>

<p>“And on whom were thy dreams employed?” said the friar
sternly. His son blushed. “Come, come,” resumed the friar,
“inconsiderate youth, this must not be; eradicate this guilty
passion from thy breast.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
“Guilty passion!” cried Theodore: “can guilt dwell with
innocent beauty and virtuous modesty?”</p>

<p>“It is sinful,” replied the friar, “to cherish those whom
Heaven has doomed to destruction. A tyrant’s race must be
swept from the earth to the third and fourth generation.”</p>

<p>“Will Heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the guilty?”
said Theodore. “The fair Matilda has virtues enough&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To undo thee,” interrupted Jerome. “Hast thou so soon
forgotten that twice the savage Manfred has pronounced thy
sentence?”</p>

<p>“Nor have I forgotten, sir,” said Theodore, “that the charity
of his daughter delivered me from his power. I can forget
injuries, but never benefits.”</p>

<p>“The injuries thou hast received from Manfred’s race,” said
the friar, “are beyond what thou canst conceive. Reply not,
but view this holy image! Beneath this marble monument
rest the ashes of the good Alfonso; a prince adorned with every
virtue; the father of his people; the delight of mankind! Kneel,
headstrong boy, and list, while a father unfolds a tale of horror,
that will expel every sentiment from thy soul, but sensations
of sacred vengeance. Alfonso! much injured prince! let thy
unsatisfied shade sit awful on the troubled air, while these
trembling lips&mdash;&mdash;Ha! who comes there?”</p>

<p>“The most wretched of women,” said Hippolita, entering the
choir. “Good father, art thou at leisure? but why this kneeling
youth? What means the horror imprinted on each countenance?
Why at this venerable tomb?&mdash;alas! hast thou seen aught?”</p>

<p>“We were pouring forth our orisons to Heaven,” replied the
friar, with some confusion, “to put an end to the woes of this
deplorable province. Join with us, lady: thy spotless soul may
obtain an exemption from the judgments which the portents
of these days but too speakingly denounce against thy house.”</p>

<p>“I pray fervently to Heaven to divert them,” said the pious
princess. “Thou knowest it has been the occupation of my
life to wrest a blessing for my lord and my harmless children.
One, alas! is taken from me; would Heaven but hear me for my
poor Matilda! Father, intercede for her.”</p>

<p>“Every heart will bless her!” cried Theodore with rapture.</p>

<p>“Be dumb, rash youth,” said Jerome. “And thou, fond
princess, contend not with the powers above. The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away: bless His holy name, and submit
to His decrees.”</p>

<p>“I do most devoutly,” said Hippolita; “but will He not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
spare my only comfort? Must Matilda perish too?&mdash;Ah, father,
I came&mdash;but dismiss thy son. No ear but thine must hear
what I have to utter.”</p>

<p>“May Heaven grant thy every wish, most excellent princess!”
said Theodore, retiring. Jerome frowned.</p>

<p>Hippolita then acquainted the friar with a proposal she had
suggested to Manfred, his approbation of it, and the tender of
Matilda that he was gone to make to Frederic. Jerome could
not conceal his dislike of the motion, which he covered under
pretence of the improbability that Frederic, the nearest of
blood to Alfonso, and who was come to claim his succession,
would yield to an alliance with the usurper of his right. But
nothing could equal the perplexity of the friar, when Hippolita
confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation, and
demanded his opinion on the legality of her acquiescence. The
friar catched eagerly at her request of his advice; and without
explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of Manfred
and Isabella, he painted to Hippolita, in the most alarming
colours, the sinfulness of her consent, denounced judgments
against her if she complied, and enjoined her, in the severest
terms, to treat any such proposition with every mark of
indignation and refusal.</p>

<p>Manfred, in the meantime, had broken his purpose to Frederic,
and proposed the double marriage. That weak prince, who had
been struck with the charms of Matilda, listened but too eagerly
to the offer. He forgot his enmity to Manfred, whom he saw
but little hope of dispossessing by force; and flattering himself
that no issue might succeed from the union of his daughter
with the tyrant, he looked upon his own succession to the
principality as facilitated by wedding Matilda. He made faint
opposition to the proposal; affecting, for form only, not to
acquiesce unless Hippolita should consent to the divorce.
Manfred took that upon himself. Transported with his success,
and impatient to see himself in a situation to expect sons, he
hastened to his wife’s apartment, determined to extort her
compliance. He learned with indignation that she was absent
at the convent. His guilt suggested to him that she had
probably been informed by Isabella of his purpose. He doubted
whether her retirement to the convent did not import an intention
of remaining there, until she could raise obstacles to their
divorce; and the suspicions he had already entertained of
Jerome made him apprehend that the friar would not only
traverse his views, but might have inspired Hippolita with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
resolution of taking sanctuary. Impatient to unravel this clue,
and to defeat its success, Manfred hastened to the convent, and
arrived there, as the friar was earnestly exhorting the princess
never to yield to the divorce.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Manfred, “what business drew you hither?
why did you not await my return from the marquis?”</p>

<p>“I came to implore a blessing on your councils,” replied
Hippolita.</p>

<p>“My councils do not need a friar’s intervention,” said Manfred;
“and of all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom
you delight to confer with?”</p>

<p>“Profane prince!” said Jerome; “is it at the altar thou
choosest to insult the servants of the altar?&mdash;but, Manfred, thy
impious schemes are known. Heaven and this virtuous lady
know them:&mdash;nay, frown not, prince. The Church despises thy
menaces. Her thunders will be heard above thy wrath. Dare
to proceed in thy cursed purpose of a divorce, until her sentence
be known, and here I launch her anathema at thy head.”</p>

<p>“Audacious rebel!” said Manfred, endeavouring to conceal
the awe with which the friar’s words inspired him; “dost thou
presume to threaten thy lawful prince?”</p>

<p>“Thou art no lawful prince,” said Jerome; “thou art no
prince:&mdash;go, discuss thy claim with Frederic; and when that
is done&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is done,” replied Manfred: “Frederic accepts Matilda’s
hand, and is content to waive his claim, unless I have no male
issue.”&mdash;As he spoke those words, three drops of blood fell
from the nose of Alfonso’s statue. Manfred turned pale, and
the princess sunk on her knees.</p>

<p>“Behold!” said the friar; “mark this miraculous indication
that the blood of Alfonso will never mix with that of Manfred!”</p>

<p>“My gracious lord,” said Hippolita, “let us submit ourselves
to Heaven. Think not thy ever obedient wife rebels against
thy authority. I have no will but that of my lord and the
Church. To that revered tribunal let us appeal. It does not
depend on us to burst the bonds that unite us. If the Church
shall approve the dissolution of our marriage, be it so&mdash;I have
but few years, and those of sorrow, to pass. Where can they
be worn away so well as at the foot of this altar, in prayers for
thine and Matilda’s safety?”</p>

<p>“But thou shalt not remain here until then,” said Manfred.
“Repair with me to the castle, and there I will advise on the
proper measures for a divorce. But this meddling friar comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
not thither: my hospitable roof shall nevermore harbour a
traitor&mdash;and for thy reverence’s offspring,” continued he, “I
banish him from my dominions. He, I ween, is no sacred
personage, nor under the protection of the Church. Whoever
weds Isabella, it shall not be Father Falconara’s started-up
son.”</p>

<p>“They start up,” said the friar, “who are suddenly beheld in
the seat of lawful princes; but they wither away like the grass,
and their place knows them no more.”</p>

<p>Manfred, casting a look of scorn at the friar, led Hippolita
forth; but at the door of the church whispered one of his attendants
to remain concealed about the convent, and bring him
instant notice if any one from the castle should repair thither.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>Every reflection which Manfred made on the friar’s behaviour
conspired to persuade him that Jerome was privy to an amour
between Isabella and Theodore. But Jerome’s new presumption,
so dissonant from his former meekness, suggested still
deeper apprehensions. The prince even suspected that the
friar depended on some secret support from Frederic, whose
arrival coinciding with the novel appearance of Theodore
seemed to bespeak a correspondence. Still more was he troubled
with the resemblance of Theodore to Alfonso’s portrait. The
latter he knew had unquestionably died without issue. Frederic
had consented to bestow Isabella on him. These contradictions
agitated his mind with numberless pangs. He saw but two
methods of extricating himself from his difficulties. The one
was to resign his dominions to the marquis.&mdash;Pride, ambition,
and his reliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out
a possibility of his preserving them to his posterity, combated
that thought. The other was to press his marriage with Isabella.
After long ruminating on these anxious thoughts, as he marched
silently with Hippolita to the castle, he at last discoursed with
that princess on the subject of his disquiet, and used every
insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to,
even her promise of promoting, the divorce. Hippolita needed
little persuasions to bend her to his pleasure. She endeavoured
to win him over to the measure of resigning his dominions; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
finding her exhortations fruitless she assured him, that, as far
as her conscience would allow, she would raise no opposition to
a separation, though without better founded scruples than what
he yet alleged she would not engage to be active in demanding
it.</p>

<p>This compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise
Manfred’s hopes. He trusted that his power and wealth would
easily advance his suit at the court of Rome, whither he resolved
to engage Frederic to take a journey on purpose. That prince
had discovered so much passion for Matilda, that Manfred
hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out or withdrawing
his daughter’s charms, according as the marquis should appear
more or less disposed to co-operate in his views. Even the
absence of Frederic would be a material point gained, until he
could take further measures for his security.</p>

<p>Dismissing Hippolita to her apartment, he repaired to that
of the marquis; but crossing the great hall, through which he
was to pass, he met Bianca. The damsel he knew was in the
confidence of both the young ladies. It immediately occurred
to him to sift her on the subject of Isabella and Theodore.
Calling her aside into the recess of the oriel window of the
hall, and soothing her with many fair words and promises, he
demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state of
Isabella’s affections.</p>

<p>“I! my lord! no, my lord&mdash;yes, my lord&mdash;poor lady! she is
wonderfully alarmed about her father’s wounds! but I tell her
he will do well; don’t your highness think so?”</p>

<p>“I do not ask you,” replied Manfred, “what she thinks about
her father; but you are in her secrets. Come, be a good girl,
and tell me; is there any young man&mdash;ha!&mdash;you understand me.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless me! understand your highness, no, not I: I told
her a few vulnerary herbs and repose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am not talking,” replied the prince, impatiently, “about
her father; I know he will do well.”</p>

<p>“Bless me, I rejoice to hear your highness say so; for though
I thought it not right to let my young lady despond, methought
his greatness had a wan look, and a something&mdash;I remember
when young Ferdinand was wounded by the Venetian&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thou answerest from the point,” interrupted Manfred;
“but here, take this jewel, perhaps that may fix thy attention;
nay, no reverences: my favour shall not stop here:&mdash;come,
tell me truly, how stands Isabella’s heart.”</p>

<p>“Well, your highness has such a way!” said Bianca, “to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
sure; but can your highness keep a secret? if it should ever
come out of your lips&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It shall not, it shall not,” cried Manfred.</p>

<p>“Nay, but swear, your highness. By my halidame, if it
should ever be known that I said it&mdash;why, truth is truth, I do
not think my Lady Isabella ever much affectioned my young
lord, your son&mdash;yet he was a sweet youth, as one should see.
I am sure, if I had been a princess&mdash;but bless me! I must attend
my Lady Matilda; she will marvel what is become of me.”</p>

<p>“Stay!” cried Manfred, “thou hast not satisfied my question.
Hast thou ever carried any message, any letter?”</p>

<p>“I! good gracious!” cried Bianca; “I carry a letter? I would
not to be a queen. I hope your highness thinks, though I
am poor, I am honest&mdash;did your highness never hear what
Count Marsigli offered me when he came a-wooing to my
Lady Matilda?”</p>

<p>“I have not leisure,” said Manfred, “to listen to thy tales.
I do not question thy honesty; but it is thy duty to conceal
nothing from me. How long has Isabella been acquainted
with Theodore?”</p>

<p>“Nay, there is nothing can escape your highness,” said
Bianca: “not that I know anything of the matter. Theodore,
to be sure, is a proper young man, and, as my Lady Matilda
says, the very image of good Alfonso: has not your highness
remarked it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,&mdash;no,&mdash;thou torturest me,” said Manfred: “where
did they meet? when?”</p>

<p>“Who? my Lady Matilda?” said Bianca.</p>

<p>“No, no, not Matilda; Isabella. When did Isabella first
become acquainted with this Theodore?”</p>

<p>“Virgin Mary!” said Bianca, “how should I know?”</p>

<p>“Thou dost know,” said Manfred, “and I must know;
I will.”</p>

<p>“Lord! your highness is not jealous of young Theodore!”
said Bianca.</p>

<p>“Jealous! no, no: why should I be jealous? perhaps I
mean to unite them, if I were sure Isabella would have no
repugnance.”</p>

<p>“Repugnance! no, I’ll warrant her,” said Bianca: “he is as
comely a youth as ever trod on Christian ground. We are all
in love with him; there is not a soul in the castle but would be
rejoiced to have him for our prince&mdash;I mean, when it shall
please Heaven to call your highness to itself.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
“Indeed,” said Manfred, “has it gone so far? oh, this cursed
friar! but I must not lose time:&mdash;go, Bianca, attend Isabella;
but I charge thee, not a word of what has passed. Find out
how she is affected towards Theodore: bring me good news,
and that ring has a companion. Wait at the foot of the winding
staircase: I am going to visit the marquis, and will talk further
with thee at my return.”</p>

<p>Manfred, after some general conversation, desired Frederic
to dismiss the two knights his companions, having to talk with
him on urgent affairs. As soon as they were alone, he began,
in artful guise, to sound the marquis on the subject of Matilda;
and finding him disposed to his wish, he let drop hints on the
difficulties that would attend the celebration of their marriage,
unless&mdash;At that instant Bianca burst into the room with a
wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord, my lord!” cried she; “we are all undone! it
is come again! it is come again!”</p>

<p>“What is come again?” cried Manfred, amazed.</p>

<p>“Oh, the hand! the giant! the hand!&mdash;support me! I am
terrified out of my senses,” cried Bianca; “I will not sleep in the
castle to-night. Where shall I go? my things may come after
me to-morrow&mdash;would I had been content to wed Francesco!&mdash;this
comes of ambition.”</p>

<p>“What has terrified thee thus, young woman?” said the
marquis. “Thou art safe here; be not alarmed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your greatness is wonderfully good,” said Bianca, “but
I dare not&mdash;no, pray let me go. I had rather leave everything
behind me, than stay another hour under this roof.”</p>

<p>“Go to, thou hast lost thy senses,” said Manfred. “Interrupt
us not; we were communing on important matters. My lord,
this wench is subject to fits. Come with me, Bianca.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the saints, no,” said Bianca; “for certain it comes to
warn your highness: why should it appear to me else? I say
my prayers morning and evening. Oh, if your highness had
believed Diego! ’Tis the same hand that he saw the foot to
in the gallery chamber. Father Jerome has often told us the
prophecy would be out one of these days. ‘Bianca,’ said he,
‘mark my words&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Thou ravest,” said Manfred in a rage! “begone, and keep
these fooleries to frighten thy companions.”</p>

<p>“What, my lord!” cried Bianca, “do you think I have
seen nothing? Go to the foot of the great stairs yourself&mdash;as
I live I saw it.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
“Saw what? Tell us, fair maid, what thou hast seen,”
said Frederic.</p>

<p>“Can your highness listen,” said Manfred, “to the delirium
of a silly wench, who has heard stories of apparitions until
she believes them?”</p>

<p>“This is more than fancy,” said the marquis; “her terror is
too natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of
imagination. Tell us, fair maiden, what it is has moved
thee thus.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord, thank your greatness,” said Bianca. “I
believe I look very pale; I shall be better when I have recovered
myself. I was going to my Lady Isabella’s chamber by his
highness’s order&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We do not want the circumstances,” interrupted Manfred.
“Since his highness will have it so, proceed; but be brief.”</p>

<p>“Lord! your highness thwarts one so!” replied Bianca.
“I fear my hair&mdash;I am sure I never in my life&mdash;well, as I was
telling your greatness, I was going, by his highness’s order, to
my Lady Isabella’s chamber. She lies in the watchet-coloured
chamber, on the right hand, one pair of stairs. So when I
came to the great stairs, I was looking on his highness’s present
here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Grant me patience!” said Manfred; “will this wench never
come to the point? What imports it to the marquis, that I
gave thee a bauble for thy faithful attendance on my daughter;
we want to know what thou sawest.”</p>

<p>“I was going to tell your highness,” said Bianca, “if you
would permit me. So as I was rubbing the ring&mdash;I am sure
I had not gone up three steps, but I heard the rattling of armour;
for all the world such a clatter, as Diego says he heard when the
giant turned him about in the gallery-chamber.”</p>

<p>“What does she mean, my lord?” said the marquis: “is
your castle haunted by giants and goblins?”</p>

<p>“Lord, what, has not your greatness heard the story of the
giant in the gallery-chamber?” cried Bianca. “I marvel his
highness has not told you&mdash;mayhap you do not know there
is a prophecy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This trifling is intolerable,” interrupted Manfred. “Let
us dismiss this silly wench, my lord; we have more important
affairs to discuss.”</p>

<p>“By your favour,” said Frederic, “these are no trifles. The
enormous sabre I was directed to in the wood, yon casque, its
fellow&mdash;are these visions of this poor maiden’s brain?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
“So Jaquez thinks, may it please your greatness,” said
Bianca. “He says this moon will not be out without our
seeing some strange revolution. For my part, I should not
be surprised if it was to happen to-morrow; for, as I was saying,
when I heard the clattering of armour, I was all in a cold sweat:
I looked up, and, if your greatness will believe me, I saw upon
the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armour,
as big, as big&mdash;I thought I should have swooned&mdash;I never
stopped until I came hither. Would I were well out of this
castle! My Lady Matilda told me but yester-morning that
her highness Hippolita knows something.”</p>

<p>“Thou art an insolent!” cried Manfred. “Lord Marquis, it
much misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront me.
Are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to
my honour? Pursue your claim by manly daring; or let us
bury our feuds, as was proposed, by the intermarriage of our
children. But trust me, it ill becomes a prince of your bearing
to practise on mercenary wenches.”</p>

<p>“I scorn your imputation,” said Frederic: “until this hour
I never set eyes on this damsel. I have given her no jewel!
My lord, my lord, your conscience, your guilt accuses you, and
would throw the suspicion on me; but keep your daughter, and
think no more of Isabella. The judgments already fallen on
your house forbid me matching into it.”</p>

<p>Manfred, alarmed at the resolute tone in which Frederic
delivered these words, endeavoured to pacify him. Dismissing
Bianca, he made such submissions to the marquis, and threw
in such artful encomiums on Matilda, that Frederic was once
more staggered. However, as his passion was of so recent a
date, it could not at once surmount the scruples he had conceived.
He had gathered enough from Bianca’s discourse to
persuade him that Heaven declared itself against Manfred. The
proposed marriages, too, removed his claim to a distance; and
the principality of Otranto was a stronger temptation than the
contingent reversion of it with Matilda. Still he would not
absolutely recede from his engagements; but purposing to gain
time, he demanded of Manfred if it was true in fact that Hippolita
consented to the divorce. The prince, transported to find
no other obstacle, and depending on his influence over his wife,
assured the marquis it was so, and that he might satisfy himself
of the truth from her own mouth.</p>

<p>As they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the
banquet was prepared. Manfred conducted Frederic to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
great hall, where they were received by Hippolita and the
young princesses. Manfred placed the marquis next to Matilda,
and seated himself between his wife and Isabella. Hippolita
comported herself with an easy gravity; but the young ladies
were silent and melancholy. Manfred, who was determined to
pursue his point with the marquis in the remainder of the
evening, pushed on the feast until it waxed late; affecting
unrestrained gaiety, and plying Frederic with repeated goblets
of wine. The latter, more upon his guard than Manfred wished,
declined his frequent challenges, on pretence of his late loss of
blood; while the prince, to raise his own disordered spirits, and
to counterfeit unconcern, indulged himself in plentiful draughts,
though not to the intoxication of his senses.</p>

<p>The evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded.
Manfred would have withdrawn with Frederic; but the latter,
pleading weakness and want of repose, retired to his chamber,
gallantly telling the prince, that his daughter should amuse his
highness until himself could attend him. Manfred accepted
the party, and, to the no small grief of Isabella, accompanied
her to her apartment. Matilda waited on her mother, to enjoy
the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle.</p>

<p>Soon as the company were dispersed their several ways,
Frederic, quitting his chamber, inquired if Hippolita was alone,
and was told by one of her attendants, who had not noticed her
going forth, that at that hour she generally withdrew to her
oratory, where he probably would find her. The marquis,
during the repast, had beheld Matilda with increase of passion.
He now wished to find Hippolita in the disposition her lord had
promised. The portents that had alarmed him were forgotten
in his desires. Stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment
of Hippolita, he entered it with a resolution to encourage her
acquiescence to the divorce, having perceived that Manfred was
resolved to make the possession of Isabella an unalterable
condition, before he would grant Matilda to his wishes.</p>

<p>The marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in
the princess’s apartment. Concluding her, as he had been
advertised, in her oratory, he passed on. The door was ajar;
the evening gloomy and overcast. Pushing open the door
gently, he saw a person kneeling before the altar. As he
approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but one in a long
woollen weed, whose back was towards him. The person
seemed absorbed in prayer. The marquis was about to return,
when the figure, rising, stood some moments fixed in meditation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
without regarding him. The marquis, expecting the holy
person to come forth, and meaning to excuse his uncivil
interruption, said:</p>

<p>“Reverend father, I sought the Lady Hippolita.”</p>

<p>“Hippolita!” replied a hollow voice; “camest thou to this
castle to seek Hippolita?” And then the figure, turning slowly
round, discovered to Frederic the fleshless jaws and empty
sockets of a skeleton, wrapt in a hermit’s cowl.</p>

<p>“Angels of peace protect me!” cried Frederic, recoiling.</p>

<p>“Deserve their protection,” said the spectre.</p>

<p>Frederic, falling on his knees, adjured the phantom to take
pity on him.</p>

<p>“Dost thou not remember me?” said the apparition.
“Remember the wood of Joppa!”</p>

<p>“Art thou that holy hermit?” cried Frederic, trembling;
“can I do aught for thy eternal peace?”</p>

<p>“Wast thou delivered from bondage,” said the spectre, “to
pursue carnal delights? Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre,
and the behest of Heaven engraven on it?”</p>

<p>“I have not, I have not,” said Frederic; “but say, blest
spirit, what is thy errand to me? what remains to be done?”</p>

<p>“To forget Matilda,” said the apparition, and vanished.</p>

<p>Frederick’s blood froze in his veins. For some minutes he
remained motionless. Then falling prostrate on his face before
the altar, he besought the intercession of every saint for
pardon. A flood of tears succeeded to this transport; and the
image of the beauteous Matilda rushing, in spite of him, on his
thoughts, he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and
passion. Ere he could recover from this agony of his spirits, the
Princess Hippolita, with a taper in her hand, entered the oratory
alone. Seeing a man without motion on the floor, she gave a
shriek, concluding him dead. Her fright brought Frederic to
himself. Rising suddenly, his face bedewed with tears, he
would have rushed from her presence; but Hippolita, stopping
him, conjured him, in the most plaintive accents, to explain the
cause of his disorder, and by what strange chance she had
found him there in that posture.</p>

<p>“Ah, virtuous princess!” said the marquis, penetrated with
grief, and stopped.</p>

<p>“For the love of Heaven, my lord,” said Hippolita, “disclose
the cause of this transport! What mean these doleful sounds,
this alarming exclamation on my name? What woes has
Heaven still in store for the wretched Hippolita?&mdash;yet silent!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
By every pitying angel I adjure thee, noble prince,” continued
she, falling at his feet, “to disclose the purport of what lies at
thy heart. I see thou feelest for me; thou feelest the sharp
pangs that thou inflictest. Speak, for pity! Does aught thou
knowest concern my child!”</p>

<p>“I cannot speak,” cried Frederic, bursting from her. “Oh,
Matilda!”</p>

<p>Quitting the princess thus abruptly, he hastened to his own
apartment. At the door of it he was accosted by Manfred,
who, flushed by wine and love, had come to seek him, and to
propose to waste some hours of the night in music and revelling.
Frederic, offended at an invitation so dissonant from the mood
of his soul, pushed him rudely aside, and, entering his chamber,
flung the door intemperately against Manfred, and bolted it
inwards. The haughty prince, enraged at this unaccountable
behaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most
fatal excesses. As he crossed the court, he was met by the
domestic whom he planted at the convent as a spy on Jerome
and Theodore. This man, almost breathless with the haste he
had made, informed his lord, that Theodore and some lady from
the castle were at that instant in private conference at the
tomb of Alfonso, in St. Nicholas’s church. He had dogged
Theodore thither; but the gloominess of the night had prevented
his discovering who the woman was.</p>

<p>Manfred, whose spirits were inflamed, and whom Isabella had
driven from her on his urging his passion with too little reserve,
did not doubt but the inquietude she had expressed had been
occasioned by her impatience to meet Theodore. Provoked by
this conjecture, and enraged at her father, he hastened secretly
to the great church. Gliding softly between the aisles, and
guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly
through the illuminated windows, he stole towards the tomb
of Alfonso, to which he was directed by indistinct whispers of the
person she sought. The first sounds he could distinguish were:</p>

<p>“Does it, alas! depend on me? Manfred will never permit
our union.”</p>

<p>“No, this shall prevent it!” cried the tyrant, drawing his
dagger, and plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of
the person that spoke.</p>

<p>“Ah me, I am slain!” cried Matilda, sinking: “good Heaven,
receive my soul!”</p>

<p>“Savage, inhuman monster, what hast thou done?” cried
Theodore, rushing on him and wrenching his dagger from him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
“Stop, stop thy impious hand!” cried Matilda: “it is my
father!”</p>

<p>Manfred, waking as from a trance, beat his breast, twisted
his hands in his locks, and endeavoured to recover his dagger
from Theodore to dispatch himself. Theodore, scarce less
distracted, and only mastering the transports of his grief to
assist Matilda, had now by his cries drawn some of the monks
to his aid. While part of them endeavoured, in concert with
the afflicted Theodore, to stop the blood of the dying princess,
the rest prevented Manfred from laying violent hands on himself.</p>

<p>Matilda, resigning herself patiently to her fate, acknowledged,
with looks of grateful love, the zeal of Theodore. Yet oft, as
her faintness would permit her speech its way, she begged the
assistants to comfort her father.</p>

<p>Jerome, by this time, had learnt the fatal news, and reached
the church. His looks seemed to reproach Theodore; but
turning to Manfred, he said, “Now, tyrant, behold the completion
of woe fulfilled on thy impious and devoted head! The
blood of Alfonso cried to Heaven for vengeance; and Heaven
has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination, that
thou mightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that prince’s
sepulchre!”</p>

<p>“Cruel man,” cried Matilda, “to aggravate the woes of a
parent! may Heaven bless my father, and forgive him as I do!
My lord, my gracious sire, dost thou forgive thy child? Indeed
I came not hither to meet Theodore. I found him praying at
this tomb, whither my mother sent me to intercede for thee, for
her&mdash;dearest father, bless your child, and say you forgive her.”</p>

<p>“Forgive thee, murderous monster,” cried Manfred, “can
assassins forgive? I took thee for Isabella; but Heaven directed
my bloody hand to the heart of my child&mdash;oh, Matilda, I cannot
utter it: canst thou forgive the blindness of my rage?”</p>

<p>“I can, I do, and may Heaven confirm it,” said Matilda;
“but while I have life to ask it&mdash;oh, my mother, what will she
feel! will you comfort her, my lord, will you not put her away?
indeed she loves you&mdash;oh, I am faint; bear me to the castle&mdash;can
I live to have her close my eyes?”</p>

<p>Theodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer
herself to be borne into the convent; but her instances were so
pressing to be carried to the castle, that, placing her on a litter,
they conveyed her thither as she requested. Theodore, supporting
her head with his arm, and hanging over her in an
agony of despairing love, still endeavoured to inspire her with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
hopes of life. Jerome on the other side comforted her with
discourses of heaven; and holding a crucifix before her, which
she bathed with innocent tears, prepared her for her passage
to immortality. Manfred, plunged in the deepest affliction,
followed the litter in despair.</p>

<p>Ere they reached the castle, Hippolita, informed of the
dreadful catastrophe, had flown to meet her murdered child;
but when she saw the afflicted procession, the mightiness of her
grief deprived her of her senses, and she fell lifeless to the earth
in a swoon. Isabella and Frederic, who attended her, were
overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow. Matilda alone seemed
insensible to her own situation: every thought was lost in
tenderness for her mother. Ordering the litter to stop, as soon
as Hippolita was brought to herself, she asked for her father.
He approached, unable to speak. Matilda, seizing his hand
and her mother’s, locked them in her own, and then clasped
them to her heart. Manfred could not support this act of
pathetic piety. He dashed himself on the ground, and cursed
the day he was born. Isabella, apprehensive that these struggles
of passion were more than Matilda could support, took upon
herself to order Manfred to be borne to his apartment, while
she caused Matilda to be conveyed to the nearest chamber.
Hippolita, scarce more alive than her daughter, was regardless
of everything but her; but when the tender Isabella’s care
would have likewise removed her, while the surgeons examined
Matilda’s wound, she cried:</p>

<p>“Remove me! never! never! never! I lived but in her, and
will expire with her.” Matilda raised her eyes at her mother’s
voice, but closed them again without speaking. Her sinking
pulse and the damp coldness of her hand soon dispelled all
hopes of recovery. Theodore followed the surgeons into the
outer chamber, and heard them pronounce the fatal sentence
with a transport equal to frenzy.</p>

<p>“Since she cannot live mine,” cried he, “at least she shall
be mine in death! Father! Jerome! will you not join our
hands?” cried he to the friar, who with the marquis had
accompanied the surgeons.</p>

<p>“What means thy distracted rashness?” said Jerome; “is
this an hour for marriage?”</p>

<p>“It is, it is,” cried Theodore: “alas! there is no other!”</p>

<p>“Young man, thou art too unadvised,” said Frederic: “dost
thou think we are to listen to thy fond transports in this hour
of fate? what pretensions hast thou to the princess?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
“Those of a prince,” said Theodore, “of the sovereign of
Otranto. This reverend man, my father, has informed me
who I am.”</p>

<p>“Thou ravest,” said the marquis: “there is no prince of
Otranto but myself, now Manfred, by murder, by sacrilegious
murder, has forfeited all pretensions.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Jerome, assuming an air of command, “he
tells you true. It was not my purpose the secret should have
been divulged so soon; but fate presses onward to its work.
What his hot-headed passion has revealed, my tongue confirms.
Know, prince, that when Alfonso set sail for the Holy
Land&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is this a season for explanations?” cried Theodore. “Father,
come and unite me to the princess; she shall be mine&mdash;in every
other thing I will dutifully obey you. My life; my adored
Matilda!” continued Theodore, rushing back into the inner
chamber, “will you not be mine? will you not bless your&mdash;&mdash;”
Isabella made signs to him to be silent, apprehending the
princess was near her end. “What, is she dead?” cried Theodore;
“is it possible?” The violence of his exclamations brought
Matilda to herself. Lifting up her eyes, she looked around for
her mother.</p>

<p>“Life of my soul! I am here,” cried Hippolita; “think not
I will quit thee!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are too good,” said Matilda; “but weep not for me,
my mother! I am going where sorrow never dwells;&mdash;Isabella,
thou hast loved me: wo’t thou not supply my fondness to this
dear, dear woman?&mdash;Indeed I am faint!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my child, my child!” said Hippolita, in a flood of
tears, “can I not withhold thee a moment?”</p>

<p>“It will not be,” said Matilda: “commend me to Heaven&mdash;where
is my father? Forgive him, dearest mother&mdash;forgive
him my death; it was an error. Oh, I had forgotten, dearest
mother, I vowed never to see Theodore more&mdash;perhaps that
has drawn down this calamity, but it was not intentional&mdash;can
you pardon me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, wound not my agonizing soul,” said Hippolita;
“thou never couldst offend me. Alas! she faints! help!
help!”</p>

<p>“I would say something more,” said Matilda, struggling,
“but it wonnot be&mdash;Isabella&mdash;Theodore&mdash;for my sake&mdash;oh!”
She expired. Isabella and her women tore Hippolita from the
corse; but Theodore threatened destruction to all who attempted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to remove him from it. He printed a thousand kisses on her
clay-cold hands, and uttered every expression that despairing
love could dictate.</p>

<p>Isabella, in the meantime, was accompanying the afflicted
Hippolita to her apartment; but in the middle of the court
they were met by Manfred, who, distracted with his own
thoughts, and anxious once more to behold his daughter, was
advancing towards the chamber where she lay. As the moon
was now at its height, he read in the countenances of this
unhappy company the event he dreaded.</p>

<p>“What! is she dead?” cried he in wild confusion: a clap of
thunder at that instant shook the castle to its foundations; the
earth rocked, and the clank of more than mortal armour was
heard behind. Frederic and Jerome thought the last day was
at hand. The latter, forcing Theodore along with them, rushed
into the court. The moment Theodore appeared, the walls of
the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with a mighty
force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense magnitude,
appeared in the centre of the ruins.</p>

<p>“Behold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso!” said the
vision; and having pronounced those words, accompanied by
a clap of thunder, it ascended solemnly towards heaven, where
the clouds parting asunder, the form of St. Nicholas was seen,
and receiving Alfonso’s shade, they were soon wrapt from
mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>The beholders fell prostrate on their faces, acknowledging
the divine will. The first that broke silence was Hippolita.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said she to the desponding Manfred, “behold
the vanity of human greatness! Conrad is gone! Matilda is no
more! in Theodore we view the true Prince of Otranto. By
what miracle he is so, I know not&mdash;suffice it to us, our doom is
pronounced! Shall we not&mdash;can we but&mdash;dedicate the few
deplorable hours we have to live, in deprecating the further
wrath of Heaven? Heaven ejects us: whither can we fly, but
to yon holy cells that yet offer us a retreat?”</p>

<p>“Thou guiltless but unhappy woman! unhappy by my
crimes!” replied Manfred, “my heart at last is open to thy
devout admonitions. Oh, could&mdash;but it cannot be&mdash;ye are lost
in wonder,&mdash;let me at last do justice on myself! To heap
shame on my own head is all the satisfaction I have left to
offer to offended Heaven. My story has drawn down these
judgments: let my confession atone&mdash;but ah! what can atone
for usurpation and a murdered child; a child murdered in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
consecrated place? List, sirs, and may this bloody record be
a warning to future tyrants!</p>

<p>“Alfonso, ye all know, died in the Holy Land&mdash;ye would
interrupt me&mdash;ye would say he came not fairly to his end&mdash;it
is most true&mdash;why else this bitter cup which Manfred must
drink to the dregs? Ricardo, my grandfather, was his chamberlain&mdash;I
would draw a veil over my ancestor’s crimes, but it is
in vain! Alfonso died by poison. A fictitious will declared
Ricardo his heir. His crimes pursued him. Yet he lost no
Conrad, no Matilda! I pay the price of usurpation for all. A
storm overtook him. Haunted by his guilt, he vowed to
St. Nicholas to found a church and two convents, if he lived
to reach Otranto. The sacrifice was accepted: the saint
appeared to him in a dream, and promised that Ricardo’s
posterity should reign in Otranto, until the rightful owner
should be grown too large to inhabit the castle, and as long as
issue-male from Ricardo’s loins should remain to enjoy it.
Alas! alas! nor male nor female, except myself, remains of all
his wretched race!&mdash;I have done&mdash;the woes of these three days
speak the rest. How this young man can be Alfonso’s heir,
I know not&mdash;yet I do not doubt it. His are these dominions:
I resign them&mdash;yet I knew not Alfonso had an heir&mdash;I question
not the will of Heaven&mdash;poverty and prayer must fill up the
woeful space, until Manfred shall be summoned to Ricardo.”</p>

<p>“What remains is my part to declare,” said Jerome. “When
Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land, he was driven by a storm
to the coast of Sicily. The other vessel, which bore Ricardo
and his train, as your <i>lordship</i> must have heard, was separated
from him.”</p>

<p>“It is most true,” said Manfred; “and the title you give me
is more than an outcast can claim&mdash;well! be it so&mdash;proceed.”</p>

<p>Jerome blushed, and continued.</p>

<p>“For three months Lord Alfonso was wind-bound in Sicily.
There he became enamoured of a fair virgin, named Victoria.
He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures. They
were married. Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the
holy vow of arms by which he was bound, he determined to
conceal their nuptials, until his return from the crusado, when
he purposed to seek and acknowledge her for his lawful wife.
He left her pregnant. During his absence she was delivered of
a daughter; but scarce had she felt a mother’s pangs, ere she
heard the fatal rumour of her lord’s death, and the succession
of Ricardo. What could a friendless, helpless woman do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
would her testimony avail?&mdash;yet, my lord, I have an authentic
writing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It needs not,” said Manfred; “the horrors of these days,
the vision we have but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence
beyond a thousand parchments. Matilda’s death and my
expulsion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be composed, my lord,” said Hippolita; “this holy man
did not mean to recall your griefs.”</p>

<p>Jerome proceeded.</p>

<p>“I shall not dwell on what is needless. The daughter of
which Victoria was delivered was, at her maturity, bestowed in
marriage on me. Victoria died; and the secret remained locked
in my breast. Theodore’s narrative has told the rest.”</p>

<p>The friar ceased. The disconsolate company retired to the
remaining part of the castle. In the morning, Manfred signed
his abdication of the principality, with the approbation of
Hippolita, and each took on them the habit of religion in the
neighbouring convents. Frederic offered his daughter to the
new prince, which Hippolita’s tenderness for Isabella concurred
to promote. But Theodore’s grief was too fresh to admit the
thought of another love; and it was not until after frequent
discourses with Isabella of his dear Matilda, that he was
persuaded he could know no happiness, but in the society of
one with whom he could for ever indulge the melancholy that
had taken possession of his soul.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM BECKFORD</h3>

<p>William Beckford was born at Fonthill on 29 September, 1759. He
was educated by a private tutor and grew up with many of the qualities
of his own caliph Vathek. He received musical instruction under Mozart.
Chatham pronounced him “all fire and air,” and warned him against
reading <i>The Arabian Nights</i>. At seventeen he wrote an elaborate mystification,
<i>Memoirs of Extraordinary Painters</i>, a satire on the biographies
in the <i>Vies des Peintres Flamands</i>. His mother disliking English universities,
he went to complete his education at Geneva, where he remained
for a year and a half. From 1780-2 he travelled in the Low Countries
and Italy. An account of these travels was published anonymously in
1783 as <i>Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents, in a series of letters from
various parts of Europe</i>. The work was almost immediately destroyed
with the exception of six copies. At one time a legend existed that he
wrote <i>Vathek</i> in three days and two nights at a single sitting! This feat
has since been disproved by the publication of the author’s own correspondence.
At any rate, the book was written between 1781-2 in French,
and the English version, made by the Rev. Henley, was published surreptitiously
by that gentleman as a translation from the Arabic in 1784.
In protest, Beckford published the original, long before he had intended,
at Paris and Lausanne, in 1787. In 1783 he had married Lady Margaret
Gordon, the daughter of the Earl of Aboyne, and lived with her in Switzerland
until her death three years later. He had two daughters by her.
In 1787 he visited Portugal, and his Portuguese letters are the most
valuable he ever wrote. At Lausanne he bought Gibbon’s library and
shut himself up to read it. He was elected M.P. for Wells (1784-90) and
Hindon (1790-4), to which seat he was re-elected in 1806. But during
this time he had become more and more absorbed in collecting. He
wrote two burlesques on the sentimental novels of his time, <i>The Elegant
Enthusiast</i> (1796) and <i>Azemia</i> (1797). But he had already settled down
at Fonthill and was giving himself up to all kinds of artistic and architectural
extravagances. With his enormous wealth he was able to rebuild
the old family mansion on a grand scale, pull it down and rebuild it again
yet more sumptuously on a different site. But unfortunately a tower,
three hundred feet high, he had erected fell from the very haste of its
construction. It was succeeded by another which, later, also fell down.
Beckford now shut himself up in his palace with a physician, a majordomo,
and a French abbé, and in this seclusion he spent twenty years,
still collecting books and works of art. His expenditure for sixteen
years is stated by himself to be upwards of a quarter of a million. In
1822 he was forced to dispose of Fonthill and the greater part of the
contents, the sale of which lasted thirty-seven days. When the public
were admitted, Hazlitt described Fonthill as “a desert of magnificence,
a glittering waste of laborious idleness, a cathedral turned into a toyshop....”
After the sale Beckford removed to Bath where he created
a miniature Fonthill. He died there on 2 May, 1844, his face showing
scarcely a trace of age.</p>

<h3>VATHEK</h3>

<p>Vathek, ninth caliph<a href="#Note_195a" name="Note_1" id="Note_1" class="nanchor">*</a> of the race of the Abassides, was the son
of Motassem, and the grandson of Haroun al Raschid. From an
early accession to the throne, and the talents he possessed to
adorn it, his subjects were induced to expect that his reign
would be long and happy. His figure was pleasing and majestic:
but when he was angry, one of his eyes became so terrible,
that no person could bear to behold it; and the wretch upon
whom it was fixed instantly fell backward, and sometimes
expired. For fear, however, of depopulating his dominions
and making his palace desolate, he but rarely gave way to
his anger.</p>

<p>Being much addicted to women and the pleasures of the table,
he sought by his affability to procure agreeable companions;
and he succeeded the better as his generosity was unbounded
and his indulgences unrestrained: for he did not think, with
the Caliph Omar Ben Abdalaziz,<a href="#Note_195b" name="Note_2" id="Note_2" class="nanchor">*</a> that it was necessary to make
a hell of this world to enjoy paradise in the next.</p>

<p>He surpassed in magnificence all his predecessors. The
palace of Alkoremi, which his father, Motassem, had erected
on the hill of Pied Horses, and which commanded the whole
city of Samarah,<a href="#Note_195c" name="Note_3" id="Note_3" class="nanchor">*</a> was, in his idea, far too scanty: he added,
therefore, five wings, or rather other palaces, which he destined
for the particular gratification of each of the senses.</p>

<p>In the first of these were tables continually covered with the
most exquisite dainties; which were supplied both by night and
by day, according to their constant consumption; whilst the
most delicious wines and the choicest cordials flowed forth
from a hundred fountains that were never exhausted. This
palace was called <i>The Eternal or Unsatiating Banquet</i>.</p>

<p>The second was styled <i>The Temple of Melody, or the Nectar
of the Soul</i>. It was inhabited by the most skilful musicians
and admired poets of the time; who not only displayed their
talents within, but dispersing in bands without, caused every
surrounding scene to reverberate their songs, which were
continually varied in the most delightful succession.<a href="#Note_195d" name="Note_4" id="Note_4" class="nanchor">*</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
The palace named <i>The Delight of the Eyes, or the Support
of Memory</i>, was one entire enchantment. Rarities, collected
from every corner of the earth, were there found in such profusion
as to dazzle and confound, but for the order in which
they were arranged. One gallery exhibited the pictures of the
celebrated Mani,<a href="#Note_196a" name="Note_5" id="Note_5" class="nanchor">*</a> and statues that seemed to be alive. Here
a well-managed perspective attracted the sight; there the magic
of optics agreeably deceived it: whilst the naturalist, on his
part, exhibited in their several classes the various gifts that
Heaven had bestowed on our globe. In a word, Vathek omitted
nothing in this palace that might gratify the curiosity of those
who resorted to it, although he was not able to satisfy his
own; for, of all men, he was the most curious.</p>

<p><i>The Palace of Perfumes</i>, which was termed likewise <i>The
Incentive to Pleasure</i>, consisted of various halls, where the
different perfumes which the earth produces were kept perpetually
burning in censers of gold. Flambeaux and aromatic
lamps were here lighted in open day. But the too powerful
effects of this agreeable delirium might be alleviated by descending
into an immense garden, where an assemblage of every
fragrant flower diffused through the air the purest odours.</p>

<p>The fifth palace, denominated <i>The Retreat of Mirth, or the
Dangerous</i>, was frequented by troops of young females, beautiful
as the Houris,<a href="#Note_196b" name="Note_6" id="Note_6" class="nanchor">*</a> and not less seducing; who never failed to receive,
with caresses, all whom the caliph allowed to approach them
and enjoy a few hours of their company.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sensuality in which Vathek indulged,
he experienced no abatement in the love of his people, who
thought that a sovereign giving himself up to pleasure was as
able to govern as one who declared himself an enemy to it.
But the unquiet and impetuous disposition of the caliph would
not allow him to rest there. He had studied so much for his
amusement in the lifetime of his father, as to acquire a great
deal of knowledge, though not a sufficiency to satisfy himself;
for he wished to know everything; even sciences that did not
exist. He was fond of engaging in disputes with the learned,
but did not allow them to push their opposition with warmth.
He stopped with presents the mouths of those whose mouths
could be stopped; whilst others, whom his liberality was unable
to subdue, he sent to prison to cool their blood, a remedy
that often succeeded.</p>

<p>Vathek discovered also a predilection for theological controversy;
but it was not with the orthodox that he usually held.<a href="#Note_196c" name="Note_7" id="Note_7" class="nanchor">*</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
By this means he induced the zealots to oppose him, and then
persecuted them in return; for he resolved, at any rate, to have
reason on his side.</p>

<p>The great prophet, Mahomet, whose vicars the caliphs are,
beheld with indignation from his abode in the seventh heaven<a href="#Note_197a" name="Note_8" id="Note_8" class="nanchor">*</a>
the irreligious conduct of such a vicegerent. “Let us leave him
to himself,” said he to the Genii,<a href="#Note_197b" name="Note_9" id="Note_9" class="nanchor">*</a> who are always ready to
receive his commands: “let us see to what lengths his folly and
impiety will carry him: if he run into excess, we shall know
how to chastise him. Assist him, therefore, to complete the
tower<a href="#Note_197c" name="Note_10" id="Note_10" class="nanchor">*</a> which, in imitation of Nimrod, he hath begun; not, like
that great warrior, to escape being drowned, but from the
insolent curiosity of penetrating the secrets of heaven:&mdash;he will
not divine the fate that awaits him.”</p>

<p>The Genii obeyed; and, when the workmen had raised their
structure a cubit in the daytime, two cubits more were added
in the night. The expedition with which the fabric arose
was not a little flattering to the vanity of Vathek: he fancied
that even insensible matter showed a forwardness to subserve
his designs; not considering that the successes of the foolish
and wicked form the first rod of their chastisement.</p>

<p>His pride arrived at its height when, having ascended, for
the first time, the fifteen hundred stairs of his tower, he cast
his eyes below, and beheld men not larger than pismires; mountains,
than shells; and cities, than bee-hives. The idea which
such an elevation inspired of his own grandeur completely
bewildered him: he was almost ready to adore himself; till,
lifting his eyes upward, he saw the stars as high above him
as they appeared when he stood on the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>He consoled himself, however, for this intruding and unwelcome
perception of his littleness, with the thought of being
great in the eyes of others; and flattered himself that the light
of his mind would extend beyond the reach of his sight, and
extort from the stars the decrees of his destiny.</p>

<p>With this view, the inquisitive prince passed most of his
nights on the summit of his tower, till becoming an adept in
the mysteries of astrology, he imagined that the planets had
disclosed to him the most marvellous adventures, which were
to be accomplished by an extraordinary personage, from a
country altogether unknown. Prompted by motives of curiosity,
he had always been courteous to strangers; but, from this
instant, he redoubled his attention, and ordered it to be
announced, by sound of trumpet, through all the streets of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Samarah, that no one of his subjects, on peril of his displeasure,
should either lodge or detain a traveller, but forthwith bring
him to the palace.</p>

<p>Not long after this proclamation, arrived in his metropolis a
man so abominably hideous, that the very guards who arrested
him were forced to shut their eyes as they led him along: the
caliph himself appeared startled at so horrible a visage; but
joy succeeded to this emotion of terror, when the stranger
displayed to his view such rarities as he had never before seen,<a href="#Note_198a" name="Note_11" id="Note_11" class="nanchor">*</a>
and of which he had no conception.</p>

<p>In reality, nothing was ever so extraordinary as the merchandise
this stranger produced; most of his curiosities, which
were not less admirable for their workmanship than splendour,
had, besides, their several virtues described on a parchment
fastened to each. There were slippers, which, by spontaneous
springs, enabled the feet to walk; knives, that cut without
motion of the hand; sabres, that dealt the blow at the person
they were wished to strike; and the whole enriched with gems
that were hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>The sabres especially, the blades of which emitted a dazzling
radiance, fixed, more than all the rest, the caliph’s attention;
who promised himself to decipher, at his leisure, the uncouth
characters<a href="#Note_198b" name="Note_12" id="Note_12" class="nanchor">*</a> engraven on their sides. Without, therefore,
demanding their price, he ordered all the coined gold to be
brought from his treasury, and commanded the merchant to
take what he pleased. The stranger obeyed, took little, and
remained silent.</p>

<p>Vathek, imagining that the merchant’s taciturnity was
occasioned by the awe which his presence inspired, encouraged
him to advance, and asked him, with an air of condescension,
who he was? whence he came? and where he obtained such
beautiful commodities? The man, or rather monster, instead
of making a reply, thrice rubbed his forehead, which, as well as
his body, was blacker than ebony; four times clapped his paunch,
the projection of which was enormous; opened wide his huge
eyes, which glowed like firebrands; began to laugh with a
hideous noise, and discovered his long amber-coloured teeth,
bestreaked with green.</p>

<p>The caliph, though a little startled, renewed his inquiries,
but without being able to procure a reply. At which, beginning
to be ruffled, he exclaimed, “Knowest thou, wretch, who I
am, and at whom thou art aiming thy gibes?”&mdash;Then, addressing
his guards, “Have ye heard him speak?&mdash;is he dumb?”&mdash;“He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
hath spoken,” they replied, “but to no purpose.”&mdash;“Let
him speak then again,” said Vathek, “and tell me who he is,
from whence he came, and where he procured these singular
curiosities; or I swear, by the ass of Balaam, that I will make
him rue his pertinacity.”</p>

<p>This menace was accompanied by one of the caliph’s angry
and perilous glances, which the stranger sustained without the
slightest emotion; although his eyes were fixed on the terrible
eye of the prince.</p>

<p>No words can describe the amazement of the courtiers, when
they beheld this rude merchant withstand the encounter
unshocked. They all fell prostrate with their faces on the
ground, to avoid the risk of their lives; and would have continued
in the same abject posture, had not the caliph exclaimed,
in a furious tone, “Up, cowards! seize the miscreant! see that
he be committed to prison, and guarded by the best of my
soldiers! Let him, however, retain the money I gave him; it
is not my intent to take from him his property; I only want
him to speak.”</p>

<p>No sooner had he uttered these words, than the stranger was
surrounded, pinioned, and bound with strong fetters, and
hurried away to the prison of the great tower, which was encompassed
by seven empalements of iron bars, and armed with
spikes in every direction, longer and sharper than spits. The
caliph, nevertheless, remained in the most violent agitation.
He sat down indeed to eat; but, of the three hundred dishes
that were daily placed before him, he could taste of no more
than thirty-two.</p>

<p>A diet to which he had been so little accustomed was sufficient
of itself to prevent him from sleeping; what then must
be its effect when joined to the anxiety that preyed upon
his spirits? At the first glimpse of dawn he hastened to the
prison, again to importune this intractable stranger; but the
rage of Vathek exceeded all bounds on finding the prison empty,
the grates burst asunder, and his guards lying lifeless around
him. In the paroxysm of his passion he fell furiously on the
poor carcasses, and kicked them till evening without intermission.
His courtiers and viziers exerted their efforts to soothe
his extravagance; but, finding every expedient ineffectual, they
all united in one vociferation, “The caliph is gone mad! the
caliph is out of his senses!”</p>

<p>This outcry, which soon resounded through the streets of
Samarah, at length reached the ears of Carathis, his mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
who flew in the utmost consternation to try her ascendency on
the mind of her son. Her tears and caresses called off his
attention; and he was prevailed upon, by her entreaties, to be
brought back to the palace.</p>

<p>Carathis, apprehensive of leaving Vathek to himself, had him
put to bed; and, seating herself by him, endeavoured by her
conversation to appease and compose him. Nor could any one
have attempted it with better success; for the caliph not only
loved her as a mother, but respected her as a person of superior
genius. It was she who had induced him, being a Greek herself,
to adopt the sciences and systems of her country, which all good
Mussulmans hold in such thorough abhorrence.</p>

<p>Judicial astrology was one of those sciences in which Carathis
was a perfect adept. She began, therefore, with reminding her
son of the promise which the stars had made him; and intimated
an intention of consulting them again. “Alas!” said the caliph
as soon as he could speak, “what a fool I have been! not for
having bestowed forty thousand kicks on my guards, who so
tamely submitted to death; but for never considering that this
extraordinary man was the same that the planets had foretold;
whom, instead of ill-treating, I should have conciliated by all
the arts of persuasion.”</p>

<p>“The past,” said Carathis, “cannot be recalled; but it
behoves us to think of the future: perhaps you may again see
the object you so much regret: it is possible the inscriptions on
the sabres will afford information. Eat, therefore, and take
thy repose, my dear son. We will consider, to-morrow, in
what manner to act.”</p>

<p>Vathek yielded to her counsel as well as he could, and arose
in the morning with a mind more at ease. The sabres he
commanded to be instantly brought; and, poring upon them,
through a coloured glass, that their glittering might not dazzle,
he set himself in earnest to decipher the inscriptions; but his
reiterated attempts were all of them nugatory: in vain did he
beat his head, and bite his nails; not a letter of the whole was
he able to ascertain. So unlucky a disappointment would have
undone him again, had not Carathis, by good fortune, entered
the apartment.</p>

<p>“Have patience, my son!” said she: “you certainly are
possessed of every important science; but the knowledge of
languages is a trifle at best, and the accomplishment of none
but a pedant. Issue a proclamation, that you will confer such
rewards as become your greatness upon any one that shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
interpret what you do not understand, and what is beneath you
to learn; you will soon find your curiosity gratified.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” said the caliph; “but, in the meantime,
I shall be horribly disgusted by a crowd of smatterers, who will
come to the trial as much for the pleasure of retailing their
jargon as from the hope of gaining the reward. To avoid this
evil, it will be proper to add, that I will put every candidate to
death, who shall fail to give satisfaction; for, thank Heaven!
I have skill enough to distinguish, whether one translates or
invents.”</p>

<p>“Of that I have no doubt,” replied Carathis; “but to put
the ignorant to death is somewhat severe, and may be productive
of dangerous effects. Content yourself with commanding their
beards to be burnt: beards in a state are not quite so essential
as men.”</p>

<p>The caliph submitted to the reasons of his mother; and,
sending for Morakanabad, his prime vizier, said, “Let the
common criers proclaim, not only in Samarah, but throughout
every city in my empire, that whosoever will repair hither and
decipher certain characters which appear to be inexplicable,
shall experience that liberality for which I am renowned; but
that all who fail upon trial shall have their beards burnt off<a href="#Note_201a" name="Note_13" id="Note_13" class="nanchor">*</a>
to the last hair. Let them add, also, that I will bestow fifty
beautiful slaves, and as many jars of apricots from the Isle
of Kirmith, upon any man that shall bring me intelligence of
the stranger.”</p>

<p>The subjects of the caliph, like their sovereign, being great
admirers of women and apricots from Kirmith, felt their mouths
water at these promises, but were totally unable to gratify their
hankering; for no one knew what had become of the stranger.</p>

<p>As to the caliph’s other requisition, the result was different.
The learned, the half-learned, and those who were neither,
but fancied themselves equal to both, came boldly to hazard
their beards, and all shamefully lost them. The exaction of
these forfeitures, which found sufficient employment for the
eunuchs, gave them such a smell of singed hair as greatly to
disgust the ladies of the seraglio, and to make it necessary
that this new occupation of their guardians should be transferred
to other hands.</p>

<p>At length, however, an old man presented himself, whose
beard was a cubit and a half longer than any that had appeared
before him. The officers of the palace whispered to each other,
as they ushered him in, “What a pity, oh! what a great pity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that such a beard should be burnt!” Even the caliph, when he
saw it, concurred with them in opinion; but his concern was
entirely needless. This venerable personage read the characters
with facility, and explained them verbatim as follows: “We
were made where everything is well made: we are the least
of the wonders of a place where all is wonderful, and deserving
the sight of the first potentate on earth.”</p>

<p>“You translate admirably!” cried Vathek; “I know to what
these marvellous characters allude. Let him receive as many
robes of honour and thousands of sequins of gold as he hath
spoken words. I am in some measure relieved from the perplexity
that embarrassed me!” Vathek invited the old man
to dine, and even to remain some days in the palace.</p>

<p>Unluckily for him, he accepted the offer; for the caliph, having
ordered him next morning to be called, said: “Read again to
me what you have read already; I cannot hear too often the
promise that is made me&mdash;the completion of which I languish
to obtain.” The old man forthwith put on his green spectacles,<a href="#Note_202a" name="Note_14" id="Note_14" class="nanchor">*</a>
but they instantly dropped from his nose, on perceiving that
the characters he had read the day preceding had given place
to others of different import. “What ails you?” asked the
caliph; “and why these symptoms of wonder?”&mdash;“Sovereign
of the world!” replied the old man, “these sabres hold another
language to-day from that they yesterday held.”&mdash;“How say
you?” returned Vathek:&mdash;“but it matters not; tell me, if you
can, what they mean.”&mdash;“It is this, my lord,” rejoined the old
man: “‘Woe to the rash mortal who seeks to know that of
which he should remain ignorant; and to undertake that which
surpasseth his power!’”&mdash;“And woe to thee!” cried the caliph,
in a burst of indignation: “to-day thou art void of understanding:
begone from my presence, they shall burn but the half of
thy beard, because thou wert yesterday fortunate in guessing:&mdash;my
gifts I never resume.” The old man, wise enough to
perceive he had luckily escaped, considering the folly of disclosing
so disgusting a truth, immediately withdrew and appeared
not again.</p>

<p>But it was not long before Vathek discovered abundant
reason to regret his precipitation; for, though he could not
decipher the characters himself, yet, by constantly poring upon
them, he plainly perceived that they every day changed; and,
unfortunately, no other candidate offered to explain them.
This perplexing occupation inflamed his blood, dazzled his
sight, and brought on such a giddiness and debility that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
could hardly support himself. He failed not, however, though
in so reduced a condition, to be often carried to his tower, as
he flattered himself that he might there read in the stars, which
he went to consult, something more congruous to his wishes:
but in this his hopes were deluded; for his eyes, dimmed by the
vapours of his head, began to subserve his curiosity so ill, that
he beheld nothing but a thick, dun cloud, which he took for
the most direful of omens.</p>

<p>Agitated with so much anxiety, Vathek entirely lost all
firmness; a fever seized him, and his appetite failed. Instead
of being one of the greatest eaters, he became as distinguished
for drinking. So insatiable was the thirst which tormented
him, that his mouth, like a funnel, was always open to receive
the various liquors that might be poured into it, and especially
cold water, which calmed him more than any other.</p>

<p>This unhappy prince, being thus incapacitated for the enjoyment
of any pleasure, commanded the palaces of the five senses
to be shut up; forbore to appear in public, either to display
his magnificence or administer justice, and retired to the inmost
apartment of his harem. As he had ever been an excellent
husband, his wives, overwhelmed with grief at his deplorable
situation, incessantly supplied him with prayers for his health,
and water for his thirst.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Princess Carathis, whose affliction no
words can describe, instead of confining herself to sobbing and
tears, was closeted daily with the vizier Morakanabad, to find
out some cure, or mitigation, of the caliph’s disease. Under
the persuasion that it was caused by enchantment, they turned
over together, leaf by leaf, all the books of magic that might
point out a remedy; and caused the horrible stranger, whom
they accused as the enchanter, to be everywhere sought for
with the strictest diligence.</p>

<p>At the distance of a few miles from Samarah stood a high
mountain, whose sides were swarded with wild thyme and
basil, and its summit overspread with so delightful a plain,
that it might have been taken for the paradise destined for the
faithful. Upon it grew a hundred thickets of eglantine and
other fragrant shrubs; a hundred arbours of roses, entwined
with jessamine and honeysuckle; as many clumps of orange
trees, cedar, and citron; whose branches, interwoven with the
palm, the pomegranate, and the vine, presented every luxury
that could regale the eye or the taste. The ground was strewed
with violets, harebells, and pansies; in the midst of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
numerous tufts of jonquils, hyacinths, and carnations perfumed
the air. Four fountains, not less clear than deep, and so
abundant as to slake the thirst of ten armies, seemed purposely
placed here to make the scene more resemble the garden of
Eden watered by four sacred rivers. Here, the nightingale
sang the birth of the rose, her well-beloved, and, at the same
time, lamented its short-lived beauty: whilst the dove deplored
the loss of more substantial pleasures; and the wakeful lark
hailed the rising light that reanimates the whole creation.
Here, more than anywhere, the mingled melodies of birds
expressed the various passions which inspired them; and the
exquisite fruits which they pecked at pleasure seemed to have
given them a double energy.</p>

<p>To this mountain Vathek was sometimes brought, for the
sake of breathing a purer air; and, especially, to drink at will
of the four fountains. His attendants were his mother, his
wives, and some eunuchs, who assiduously employed themselves
in filling capacious bowls of rock crystal, and emulously presenting
them to him. But it frequently happened that his avidity
exceeded their zeal, insomuch that he would prostrate himself
upon the ground to lap the water, of which he could never
have enough.</p>

<p>One day, when this unhappy prince had been long lying in
so debasing a posture, a voice, hoarse but strong, thus addressed
him: “Why dost thou assimilate thyself to a dog, O caliph,
proud as thou art of thy dignity and power?” At this apostrophe,
he raised up his head, and beheld the stranger that
had caused him so much affliction. Inflamed with anger at the
sight, he exclaimed, “Accursed Giaour!<a href="#Note_204a" name="Note_15" id="Note_15" class="nanchor">*</a> what comest thou
hither to do?&mdash;is it not enough to have transformed a prince
remarkable for his agility into a water budget? Perceivest
thou not, that I may perish by drinking to excess, as well as by
thirst?”</p>

<p>“Drink, then, this draught,” said the stranger, as he presented
to him a phial of a red and yellow mixture: “and, to
satiate the thirst of thy soul as well as of thy body, know that
I am an Indian, but from a region of India which is wholly
unknown.”</p>

<p>The caliph, delighted to see his desires accomplished in part,
and flattering himself with the hope of obtaining their entire
fulfilment, without a moment’s hesitation swallowed the potion,
and instantaneously found his health restored, his thirst appeased,
and his limbs as agile as ever. In the transports of his joy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Vathek leaped upon the neck of the frightful Indian, and kissed
his horrid mouth and hollow cheeks, as though they had been
the coral lips and the lilies and roses of his most beautiful wives.</p>

<p>Nor would these transports have ceased had not the eloquence
of Carathis repressed them. Having prevailed upon him to
return to Samarah, she caused a herald to proclaim as loudly
as possible: “The wonderful stranger hath appeared again;
he hath healed the caliph; he hath spoken! he hath spoken!”</p>

<p>Forthwith, all the inhabitants of this vast city quitted their
habitations, and ran together in crowds to see the procession
of Vathek and the Indian, whom they now blessed as much
as they had before execrated, incessantly shouting, “He
hath healed our sovereign; he hath spoken! he hath spoken!”
Nor were these words forgotten in the public festivals which
were celebrated the same evening, to testify the general joy;
for the poets applied them as a chorus to all the songs they
composed on this interesting subject.</p>

<p>The caliph, in the meanwhile, caused the palaces of the senses
to be again set open; and, as he found himself naturally prompted
to visit that of taste in preference to the rest, immediately
ordered a splendid entertainment, to which his great officers
and favourite courtiers were all invited. The Indian, who was
placed near the prince, seemed to think that, as a proper acknowledgment
of so distinguished a privilege, he could neither eat,
drink, nor talk too much. The various dainties were no sooner
served up than they vanished, to the great mortification of
Vathek, who piqued himself on being the greatest eater alive,
and at this time in particular was blessed with an excellent
appetite.</p>

<p>The rest of the company looked round at each other in
amazement; but the Indian, without appearing to observe it,
quaffed large bumpers to the health of each of them; sung in a
style altogether extravagant; related stories, at which he laughed
immoderately, and poured forth extemporaneous verses, which
would not have been thought bad, but for the strange grimaces
with which they were uttered. In a word, his loquacity was
equal to that of a hundred astrologers; he ate as much as a
hundred porters, and caroused in proportion.</p>

<p>The caliph, notwithstanding the table had been thirty-two
times covered, found himself incommoded by the voraciousness
of his guest, who was now considerably declined in the
prince’s esteem. Vathek, however, being unwilling to betray
the chagrin he could hardly disguise, said in a whisper to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Bababalouk, the chief of his eunuchs:<a href="#Note_206a" name="Note_16" id="Note_16" class="nanchor">*</a> “You see how enormous
his performances are in every way; what would be the consequence
should he get at my wives!&mdash;Go! redouble your
vigilance, and be sure look well to my Circassians, who would
be more to his taste than all of the rest.”</p>

<p>The bird of the morning had thrice renewed his song, when
the hour of the divan<a href="#Note_206b" name="Note_17" id="Note_17" class="nanchor">*</a> was announced. Vathek, in gratitude
to his subjects having promised to attend, immediately arose
from table and repaired thither, leaning upon his vizier, who
could scarce support him; so disordered was the poor prince by
the wine he had drunk, and still more by the extravagant
vagaries of his boisterous guest.</p>

<p>The viziers, the officers of the crown and of the law, arranged
themselves in a semicircle<a href="#Note_206c" name="Note_18" id="Note_18" class="nanchor">*</a> about their sovereign, and preserved
a respectful silence; whilst the Indian, who looked as cool as
if he had been fasting, sat down without ceremony on one of
the steps of the throne, laughing in his sleeve at the indignation
with which his temerity had filled the spectators.</p>

<p>The caliph, however, whose ideas were confused, and whose
head was embarrassed, went on administering justice at haphazard;
till at length the prime vizier,<a href="#Note_206d" name="Note_19" id="Note_19" class="nanchor">*</a> perceiving his situation,
hit upon a sudden expedient to interrupt the audience and
rescue the honour of his master, to whom he said in a whisper,
“My lord, the Princess Carathis, who hath passed the night in
consulting the planets, informs you that they portend you
evil, and the danger is urgent. Beware lest this stranger,
whom you have so lavishly recompensed for his magical gewgaws,
should make some attempt on your life: his liquor, which
at first had the appearance of effecting your cure, may be no
more than a poison, the operation of which will be sudden.
Slight not this surmise; ask him, at least, of what it was compounded,
whence he procured it; and mention the sabres which
you seem to have forgotten.”</p>

<p>Vathek, to whom the insolent airs of the stranger became
every moment less supportable, intimated to his vizier, by a
wink of acquiescence, that he would adopt his advice; and,
at once turning towards the Indian, said, “Get up, and declare
in full divan of what drugs was compounded the liquor you
enjoined me to take, for it is suspected to be poison: give also
that explanation I have so earnestly desired concerning the
sabres you sold me, and thus show your gratitude for the favours
heaped on you.”</p>

<p>Having pronounced these words in as moderate a tone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as he well could, he waited in silent expectation for an answer.
But the Indian, still keeping his seat, began to renew his loud
shouts of laughter, and exhibit the same horrid grimaces he
had shown them before, without vouchsafing a word in reply.
Vathek, no longer able to brook such insolence, immediately
kicked him from the steps; instantly descending, repeated his
blow; and persisted, with such assiduity, as incited all who were
present to follow his example. Every foot was up and aimed
at the Indian, and no sooner had any one given him a kick, than
he felt himself constrained to reiterate the stroke.</p>

<p>The stranger afforded them no small entertainment; for,
being both short and plump, he collected himself into a ball,
and rolled on all sides at the blows of his assailants, who pressed
after him, wherever he turned, with an eagerness beyond conception,
whilst their numbers were every moment increasing.
The ball, indeed, in passing from one apartment to another,
drew every person after it that came in its way; insomuch
that the whole palace was thrown into confusion, and resounded
with a tremendous clamour. The women of the harem, amazed
at the uproar, flew to their blinds to discover the cause; but no
sooner did they catch a glimpse of the ball than, feeling themselves
unable to refrain, they broke from the clutches of their
eunuchs, who, to stop their flight, pinched them till they bled;
but in vain: whilst themselves, though trembling with terror
at the escape of their charge, were as incapable of resisting the
attraction.</p>

<p>After having traversed the halls, galleries, chambers, kitchens,
gardens, and stables of the palace, the Indian at last took his
course through the courts; whilst the caliph, pursuing him closer
than the rest, bestowed as many kicks as he possibly could;
yet not without receiving now and then a few which his competitors,
in their eagerness, designed for the ball.</p>

<p>Carathis, Morakanabad, and two or three old viziers, whose
wisdom had hitherto withstood the attraction, wishing to
prevent Vathek from exposing himself in the presence of his
subjects, fell down in his way to impede the pursuit: but he,
regardless of their obstruction, leaped over their heads, and went
on as before. They then ordered the muezzins to call the people
to prayers; both for the sake of getting them out of the way,
and of endeavouring, by their petitions, to avert the calamity:
but neither of these expedients was a whit more successful.
The sight of this fatal ball was alone sufficient to draw after
it every beholder. The muezzins themselves, though they saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
it but at a distance, hastened down from their minarets,<a href="#Note_207a" name="Note_20" id="Note_20" class="nanchor">*</a> and
mixed with the crowd; which continued to increase in so surprising
a manner that scarce an inhabitant was left in Samarah
except the aged; the sick, confined to their beds; and infants
at the breast, whose nurses could run more nimbly without
them. Even Carathis, Morakanabad, and the rest, were all
become of the party. The shrill screams of the females, who
had broken from their apartments and were unable to extricate
themselves from the pressure of the crowd, together with those
of the eunuchs jostling after them, and terrified lest their
charge should escape from their sight; the execrations of husbands,
urging forward and menacing each other; kicks given
and received; stumblings and overthrows at every step; in a
word, the confusion that universally prevailed, rendered Samarah
like a city taken by storm, and devoted to absolute plunder. At
last, the cursed Indian, who still preserved his rotundity of
figure, after passing through all the streets and public places,
and leaving them empty, rolled onwards to the plain of Catoul,
and entered the valley at the foot of the mountain of the
four fountains.</p>

<p>As a continual fall of water had excavated an immense gulf
in the valley, whose opposite side was closed in by a steep
acclivity, the caliph and his attendants were apprehensive lest
the ball should bound into the chasm, and, to prevent it,
redoubled their efforts, but in vain. The Indian persevered in
his onward direction; and, as had been apprehended, glancing
from the precipice with the rapidity of lightning, was lost in
the gulf below.</p>

<p>Vathek would have followed the perfidious Giaour, had not
an invisible agency arrested his progress. The multitude that
pressed after him were at once checked in the same manner,
and a calm instantaneously ensued. They all gazed at each
other with an air of astonishment; and notwithstanding that
the loss of veils and turbans, together with torn habits, and
dust blended with sweat, presented a most laughable spectacle,
yet there was not one smile to be seen. On the contrary, all
with looks of confusion and sadness returned in silence to
Samarah, and retired to their inmost apartments, without ever
reflecting, that they had been impelled by an invisible power
into the extravagance for which they reproached themselves;
for it is but just that men, who so often arrogate to their own merit
the good of which they are but instruments, should also
attribute to themselves absurdities which they could not prevent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
The caliph was the only person who refused to leave the
valley. He commanded his tents to be pitched there, and
stationed himself on the very edge of the precipice, in spite of
the representations of Carathis and Morakanabad, who pointed
out the hazard of its brink giving way, and the vicinity to the
magician that had so cruelly tormented him. Vathek derided
all their remonstrances; and having ordered a thousand flambeaux
to be lighted, and directed his attendants to proceed in
lighting more, lay down on the slippery margin, and attempted,
by the help of this artificial splendour, to look through that
gloom, which all the fires of the empyrean had been insufficient
to pervade. One while he fancied to himself voices arising
from the depth of the gulf; at another, he seemed to distinguish
the accents of the Indian; but all was no more than the hollow
murmur of waters, and the din of the cataracts that rushed
from steep to steep down the sides of the mountain.</p>

<p>Having passed the night in this cruel perturbation, the caliph
at daybreak retired to his tent; where, without taking the
least sustenance, he continued to doze till the dusk of evening
began again to come on. He then resumed his vigils as before,
and persevered in observing them for many nights together.
At length, fatigued with so fruitless an employment, he sought
relief from change. To this end, he sometimes paced with
hasty strides across the plain; and as he wildly gazed at the
stars, reproached them with having deceived him; but, lo! on
a sudden, the clear blue sky appeared streaked over with
streams of blood, which reached from the valley even to the
city of Samarah. As this awful phenomenon seemed to touch
his tower, Vathek at first thought of repairing thither to view
it more distinctly; but, feeling himself unable to advance, and
being overcome with apprehension, he muffled up his face in
the folds of his robe.</p>

<p>Terrifying as these prodigies were, this impression upon him
was no more than momentary, and served only to stimulate
his love of the marvellous. Instead, therefore, of returning to
his palace, he persisted in the resolution of abiding where the
Indian had vanished from his view. One night, however, while
he was walking as usual on the plain, the moon and stars were
eclipsed at once, and a total darkness ensued. The earth
trembled beneath him, and a voice came forth, the voice of
the Giaour, who, in accents more sonorous than thunder, thus
addressed him: “Wouldest thou devote thyself to me? adore
the terrestrial influences, and abjure Mahomet? On these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
conditions I will bring thee to the Palace of Subterranean Fire.
There shalt thou behold, in immense depositories, the treasures
which the stars have promised thee; and which will be conferred
by those Intelligences whom thou shalt thus render propitious.
It was from thence I brought my sabres, and it is there that
Soliman Ben Daoud<a href="#Note_210a" name="Note_21" id="Note_21" class="nanchor">*</a> reposes, surrounded by the talismans that
control the world.”</p>

<p>The astonished caliph trembled as he answered, yet he
answered in a style that showed him to be no novice in preternatural
adventures: “Where art thou? be present to my eyes;
dissipate the gloom that perplexes me, and of which I deem thee
the cause. After the many flambeaux I have burnt to discover
thee, thou mayest at least grant a glimpse of thy horrible
visage.”&mdash;“Abjure then Mahomet!” replied the Indian, “and
promise me full proofs of thy sincerity: otherwise, thou shalt
never behold me again.”</p>

<p>The unhappy caliph, instigated by insatiable curiosity,
lavished his promises in the utmost profusion. The sky immediately
brightened; and, by the light of the planets which
seemed almost to blaze, Vathek beheld the earth open; and,
at the extremity of a vast black chasm, a portal of ebony, before
which stood the Indian, holding in his hand a golden key
which he sounded against the lock.</p>

<p>“How,” cried Vathek, “can I descend to thee? Come, take
me, and instantly open the portal.”&mdash;“Not so fast,” replied the
Indian, “impatient caliph! Know that I am parched with
thirst, and cannot open this door, till my thirst be thoroughly
appeased; I require the blood of fifty children. Take them
from among the most beautiful sons of thy viziers<a href="#Note_210b" name="Note_22" id="Note_22" class="nanchor">*</a> and great
men; or neither can my thirst nor thy curiosity be satisfied.
Return to Samarah; procure for me this necessary libation;
come back hither; throw it thyself into this chasm, and then
shalt thou see!”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the Indian turned his back on the caliph,
who, incited by the suggestions of demons, resolved on the
direful sacrifice. He now pretended to have regained his tranquillity,
and set out for Samarah amidst the acclamations of a
people who still loved him, and forbore not to rejoice when
they believed him to have recovered his reason. So successfully
did he conceal the emotion of his heart, that even Carathis and
Morakanabad were equally deceived with the rest. Nothing
was heard of but festivals and rejoicings. The fatal ball, which
no tongue had hitherto ventured to mention, was brought on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the tapis. A general laugh went round, though many, still
smarting under the hands of the surgeon from the hurts received
in that memorable adventure, had no great reason for mirth.</p>

<p>The prevalence of this gay humour was not a little grateful
to Vathek, who perceived how much it conduced to his project.
He put on the appearance of affability to every one; but
especially to his viziers and the grandees of his court, whom he
failed not to regale with a sumptuous banquet; during which
he insensibly directed the conversation to the children of his
guests. Having asked, with a good-natured air, which of them
were blessed with the handsomest boys, every father at once
asserted the pretensions of his own; and the contest imperceptibly
grew so warm, that nothing could have withholden
them from coming to blows but their profound reverence for
the person of the caliph. Under the pretence, therefore, of
reconciling the disputants, Vathek took upon him to decide;
and, with this view, commanded the boys to be brought.</p>

<p>It was not long before a troop of these poor children made
their appearance, all equipped by their fond mothers with
such ornaments as might give the greatest relief to their beauty,
or most advantageously display the graces of their age. But,
whilst this brilliant assemblage attracted the eyes and hearts
of every one besides, the caliph scrutinized each, in his turn,
with a malignant avidity that passed for attention, and selected
from their number the fifty whom he judged the Giaour would
prefer.</p>

<p>With an equal show of kindness as before, he proposed to
celebrate a festival on the plain, for the entertainment of his
young favourites, who, he said, ought to rejoice still more than
all at the restoration of his health, on account of the favours
he intended for them.</p>

<p>The caliph’s proposal was received with the greatest delight,
and soon published through Samarah. Litters, camels, and
horses were prepared. Women and children, old men and
young, every one placed himself as he chose. The cavalcade
set forward, attended by all the confectioners in the city and
its precincts; the populace, following on foot, composed an
amazing crowd, and occasioned no little noise. All was joy; nor
did any one call to mind what most of them had suffered when
they lately travelled the road they were now passing so gaily.</p>

<p>The evening was serene, the air refreshing, the sky clear, and
the flowers exhaled their fragrance. The beams of the declining
sun, whose mild splendour reposed on the summit of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mountain, shed a glow of ruddy light over its green declivity, and
the white flocks sporting upon it. No sounds were heard, save
the murmurs of the four fountains, and the reeds and voices of
shepherds, calling to each other from different eminences.</p>

<p>The lovely innocents, destined for the sacrifice, added not a
little to the hilarity of the scene. They approached the plain
full of sportiveness, some coursing butterflies, others culling
flowers, or picking up the shining little pebbles that attracted
their notice. At intervals they nimbly started from each
other for the sake of being caught again and mutually imparting
a thousand caresses.</p>

<p>The dreadful chasm, at whose bottom the portal of ebony
was placed, began to appear at a distance. It looked like a
black streak that divided the plain. Morakanabad and his
companions took it for some work which the caliph had ordered.
Unhappy men! little did they surmise for what it was destined.
Vathek, unwilling that they should examine it too nearly,
stopped the procession, and ordered a spacious circle to be
formed on this side, at some distance from the accursed chasm.
The body-guard of eunuchs was detached, to measure out the
lists intended for the games, and prepare the rings for the
arrows of the young archers. The fifty competitors were soon
stripped, and presented to the admiration of the spectators
the suppleness and grace of their delicate limbs. Their eyes
sparkled with a joy, which those of their fond parents reflected.
Every one offered wishes for the little candidate nearest his
heart, and doubted not of his being victorious. A breathless
suspense awaited the contests of these amiable and innocent
victims.</p>

<p>The caliph, availing himself of the first moment to retire
from the crowd, advanced towards the chasm; and there heard,
yet not without shuddering, the voice of the Indian; who,
gnashing his teeth, eagerly demanded, “Where are they?&mdash;where
are they?&mdash;perceivest thou not how my mouth waters?”&mdash;“Relentless
Giaour!” answerd Vathek, with emotion; “can
nothing content thee but the massacre of these lovely victims?
Ah! wert thou to behold their beauty, it must certainly move
thy compassion.”&mdash;“Perdition on thy compassion, babbler!”
cried the Indian: “give them me; instantly give them, or my
portal shall be closed against thee for ever!”&mdash;“Not so loudly,”
replied the caliph, blushing.&mdash;“I understand thee,” returned
the Giaour with the grin of an ogre; “thou wantest no presence
of mind: I will for a moment forbear.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
During this exquisite dialogue, the games went forward with
all alacrity, and at length concluded, just as the twilight began
to overcast the mountains. Vathek, who was still standing on
the edge of the chasm, called out, with all his might, “Let my
fifty little favourites approach me, separately; and let them
come in the order of their success. To the first, I will give my
diamond bracelet;<a href="#Note_213a" name="Note_23" id="Note_23" class="nanchor">*</a> to the second, my collar of emeralds; to the
third, my aigret of rubies; to the fourth, my girdle of topazes;
and to the rest, each a part of my dress, even down to my
slippers.”</p>

<p>This declaration was received with reiterated acclamations;
and all extolled the liberality of a prince who would thus strip
himself for the amusement of his subjects and the encouragement
of the rising generation. The caliph in the meanwhile,
undressed himself by degrees, and, raising his arm as high as he
was able, made each of the prizes glitter in the air; but whilst
he delivered it with one hand to the child who sprung forward
to receive it, he with the other pushed the poor innocent into
the gulf, where the Giaour, with a sullen muttering, incessantly
repeated, “More! more!”</p>

<p>This dreadful device was executed with so much dexterity,
that the boy who was approaching him remained unconscious
of the fate of his forerunner; and, as to the spectators, the
shades of evening, together with their distance, precluded them
from perceiving any object distinctly. Vathek, having in this
manner thrown in the last of the fifty, and, expecting that the
Giaour, on receiving him, would have presented the key, already
fancied himself as great as Soliman, and consequently above
being amenable for what he had done; when, to his utter
amazement, the chasm closed, and the ground became as entire
as the rest of the plain.</p>

<p>No language could express his rage and despair. He execrated
the perfidy of the Indian; loaded him with the most infamous
invectives; and stamped with his foot, as resolving to be heard.
He persisted in this till his strength failed him, and then fell on
the earth like one void of sense. His viziers and grandees, who
were nearer than the rest, supposed him at first to be sitting
on the grass, at play with their amiable children; but at length,
prompted by doubt, they advanced towards the spot, and
found the caliph alone, who wildly demanded what they
wanted? “Our children! our children!” cried they. “It is
assuredly pleasant,” said he, “to make me accountable for
accidents. Your children, while at play, fell from the precipice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and I should have experienced their fate, had I not suddenly
started back.”</p>

<p>At these words, the fathers of the fifty boys cried out aloud;
the mothers repeated their exclamations an octave higher;
whilst the rest, without knowing the cause, soon drowned the
voices of both with still louder lamentations of their own.
“Our caliph,” said they, and the report soon circulated, “our
caliph has played us this trick, to gratify his accursed Giaour.
Let us punish him for perfidy! let us avenge ourselves! let us
avenge the blood of the innocent! let us throw this cruel prince
into the gulf that is near, and let his name be mentioned no
more!”</p>

<p>At this rumour and these menaces, Carathis, full of consternation,
hastened to Morakanabad, and said: “Vizier, you
have lost two beautiful boys, and must necessarily be the most
afflicted of fathers; but you are virtuous, save your master.”&mdash;“I
will brave every hazard,” replied the vizier, “to rescue
him from his present danger, but afterwards will abandon him
to his fate. Bababalouk,” continued he, “put yourself at
the head of your eunuchs: disperse the mob, and, if possible,
bring back this unhappy prince to his palace.” Bababalouk
and his fraternity, felicitating each other in a low voice on their
having been spared the cares as well as the honour of paternity,
obeyed the mandate of the vizier; who, seconding their exertions
to the utmost of his power, at length accomplished his generous
enterprise; and retired, as he resolved, to lament at his leisure.</p>

<p>No sooner had the caliph re-entered his palace than Carathis
commanded the doors to be fastened; but perceiving the tumult
to be still violent, and hearing the imprecations which resounded
from all quarters, she said to her son, “Whether the populace
be right or wrong, it behoves you to provide for your safety;
let us retire to your own apartment, and from thence through
the subterranean passage, known only to ourselves, into your
tower: there, with the assistance of the mutes<a href="#Note_214a" name="Note_24" id="Note_24" class="nanchor">*</a> who never leave
it, we may be able to make a powerful resistance. Bababalouk,
supposing us to be still in the palace, will guard its avenues
for his own sake; and we shall soon find, without the counsels
of that blubberer Morakanabad, what expedient may be the
best to adopt.”</p>

<p>Vathek, without making the least reply, acquiesced in his
mother’s proposal, and repeated as he went, “Nefarious
Giaour! where art thou? hast thou not yet devoured those poor
children? where are thy sabres? thy golden key? thy talismans?”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Carathis, who guessed from these interrogations a
part of the truth, had no difficulty to apprehend in getting at
the whole as soon as he should be a little composed in his tower.
This princess was so far from being influenced by scruples,
that she was as wicked as woman could be, which is not saying
a little; for the sex pique themselves on their superiority in
every competition. The recital of the caliph, therefore,
occasioned neither terror nor surprise to his mother: she felt
no emotion but from the promises of the Giaour, and said to
her son, “This Giaour, it must be confessed, is somewhat
sanguinary in his taste; but the terrestrial powers are always
terrible; nevertheless, what the one hath promised, and the
others can confer, will prove a sufficient indemnification. No
crimes should be thought too dear for such a reward: forbear,
then, to revile the Indian; you have not fulfilled the conditions
to which his services are annexed: for instance, is not a sacrifice
to the subterranean Genii required? and should we not be prepared
to offer it as soon as the tumult is subsided? This charge
I will take on myself, and have no doubt of succeeding, by means
of your treasures, which, as there are now so many others in
store, may without fear be exhausted.” Accordingly, the
princess, who possessed the most consummate skill in the art
of persuasion, went immediately back through the subterranean
passage; and, presenting herself to the populace from a window
of the palace, began to harangue them with all the address of
which she was mistress; whilst Bababalouk showered money
from both hands amongst the crowd, who by these united means
were soon appeased. Every person retired to his home, and
Carathis returned to the tower.</p>

<p>Prayer at break of day was announced,<a href="#Note_215a" name="Note_25" id="Note_25" class="nanchor">*</a> when Carathis and
Vathek ascended the steps which led to the summit of the
tower, where they remained for some time, though the weather
was lowering and wet. This impending gloom corresponded
with their malignant dispositions; but when the sun began to
break through the clouds, they ordered a pavilion to be raised,
as a screen against the intrusion of his beams. The caliph,
overcome with fatigue, sought refreshment from repose, at the
same time hoping that significant dreams might attend on his
slumbers; whilst the indefatigable Carathis, followed by a party
of her mutes, descended to prepare whatever she judged proper
for the oblation of the approaching night.</p>

<p>By secret stairs, contrived within the thickness of the wall,
and known only to herself and her son, she first repaired to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
mysterious recesses in which were deposited the mummies that
had been wrested from the catacombs of the ancient Pharaohs.
Of these she ordered several to be taken. From thence she
resorted to a gallery where, under the guard of fifty female
negroes, mute, and blind of the right eye, were preserved the
oil of the most venomous serpents, rhinoceros’ horns, and woods
of a subtile and penetrating odour procured from the interior
of the Indies, together with a thousand other horrible rarities.
This collection had been formed for a purpose like the present,
by Carathis herself, from a presentiment that she might one
day enjoy some intercourse with the infernal powers, to whom
she had ever been passionately attached, and to whose taste
she was no stranger.</p>

<p>To familiarize herself the better with the horrors in view,
the princess remained in the company of her negresses, who
squinted in the most amiable manner from the only eye they
had, and leered, with exquisite delight, at the skulls and skeletons<a href="#Note_216a" name="Note_26" id="Note_26" class="nanchor">*</a>
which Carathis had drawn forth from her cabinets; all
of them making the most frightful contortions, and uttering
such shrill chatterings, that the princess, stunned by them and
suffocated by the potency of the exhalations, was forced to quit
the gallery, after stripping it of a part of its abominable treasures.</p>

<p>Whilst she was thus occupied, the caliph, who, instead of
the visions he expected, had acquired in these unsubstantial
regions a voracious appetite, was greatly provoked at the mutes.
For having totally forgotten their deafness, he had impatiently
asked them for food; and seeing them regardless of his demand,
he began to cuff, pinch, and bite them, till Carathis arrived to
terminate a scene so indecent, to the great content of these
miserable creatures. “Son! what means all this?” said she,
panting for breath. “I thought I heard as I came up the
shrieks of a thousand bats, torn from their crannies in the
recesses of a cavern; and it was the outcry only of these poor
mutes, whom you were so unmercifully abusing. In truth,
you but ill deserve the admirable provision I have brought you.”&mdash;“Give
it me instantly,” exclaimed the caliph; “I am perishing
for hunger!”&mdash;“As to that,” answered she, “you must
have an excellent stomach if it can digest what I have brought.”&mdash;“Be
quick,” replied the caliph;&mdash;“but, oh heavens! what
horrors! what do you intend?”&mdash;“Come, come,” returned
Carathis, “be not so squeamish; but help me to arrange everything
properly; and you shall see that what you reject with
such symptoms of disgust will soon complete your felicity. Let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
us get ready the pile for the sacrifice of to-night; and think not
of eating till that is performed: know you not, that all solemn
rites ought to be preceded by a rigorous abstinence?”</p>

<p>The caliph, not daring to object, abandoned himself to grief
and the wind that ravaged his entrails, whilst his mother went
forward with the requisite operations. Phials of serpents’ oil,
mummies, and bones, were soon set in order on the balustrade
of the tower. The pile began to rise, and in three hours was
twenty cubits high. At length darkness approached, and
Carathis, having stripped herself to her inmost garment, clapped
her hands in an impulse of ecstasy; the mutes followed her
example; but Vathek, extenuated with hunger and impatience,
was unable to support himself, and fell down in a swoon. The
sparks had already kindled the dry wood; the venomous oil
burst into a thousand blue flames; the mummies, dissolving,
emitted a thick dun vapour; and the rhinoceros’ horns, beginning
to consume, all together diffused such a stench, that the
caliph, recovering, started from his trance, and gazed wildly
on the scene in full blaze around him. The oil gushed forth
in a plenitude of streams; and the negresses, who supplied it
without intermission, united their cries to those of the princess.
At last the fire became so violent, and the flames reflected from
the polished marble so dazzling, that the caliph, unable to
withstand the heat and the blaze, effected his escape, and took
shelter under the imperial standard.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the inhabitants of Samarah, scared at the
light which shone over the city, arose in haste, ascended their
roofs, beheld the tower on fire, and hurried, half naked, to the
square. Their love for their sovereign immediately awoke;
and, apprehending him in danger of perishing in his tower,
their whole thoughts were occupied with the means of his safety.
Morakanabad flew from his retirement, wiped away his tears,
and cried out for water like the rest. Bababalouk, whose
olfactory nerves were more familiarized to magical odours,
readily conjecturing that Carathis was engaged in her favourite
amusements, strenuously exhorted them not to be alarmed.
Him, however, they treated as an old poltroon, and styled him
a rascally traitor. The camels and dromedaries were advancing
with water; but no one knew by which way to enter the tower.
Whilst the populace was obstinate in forcing the doors, a
violent north-east wind drove an immense volume of flame
against them. At first they recoiled, but soon came back with
redoubled zeal. At the same time, the stench of the horns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and mummies increasing, most of the crowd fell backwards in
a state of suffocation. Those that kept their feet mutually
wondered at the cause of the smell, and admonished each other
to retire. Morakanabad, more sick than the rest, remained in
a piteous condition. Holding his nose with one hand, every
one persisted in his efforts with the other to burst open the
doors and obtain admission. A hundred and forty of the
strongest and most resolute at length accomplished their purpose.
Having gained the staircase, by their violent exertions,
they attained a great height in a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Carathis, alarmed at the signs of her mutes, advanced to the
staircase, went down a few steps, and heard several voices calling
out from below, “You shall in a moment have water!” Being
rather alert, considering her age, she presently regained the top
of the tower, and bade her son suspend the sacrifice for some
minutes; adding, “We shall soon be enabled to render it more
grateful. Certain dolts of your subjects, imagining, no doubt,
that we were on fire, have been rash enough to break through
those doors which had hitherto remained inviolate, for the sake
of bringing up water. They are very kind, you must allow, so
soon to forget the wrongs you have done them; but that is of
little moment. Let us offer them to the Giaour; let them come
up; our mutes, who neither want strength nor experience, will
soon dispatch them, exhausted as they are with fatigue.”&mdash;“Be
it so,” answered the caliph, “provided we finish, and I
dine.” In fact, these good people, out of breath from ascending
fifteen hundred stairs in such haste, and chagrined at having
spilt by the way the water they had taken, were no sooner
arrived at the top, than the blaze of the flames and the fumes
of the mummies at once overpowered their senses. It was a
pity! for they beheld not the agreeable smile with which the
mutes and negresses adjusted the cord to their necks: these
amiable personages rejoiced, however, no less at the scene.
Never before had the ceremony of strangling been performed
with so much facility. They all fell, without the least resistance
or struggle: so that Vathek, in the space of a few moments,
found himself surrounded by the dead bodies of the most
faithful of his subjects; all which were thrown on the top of the
pile. Carathis, whose presence of mind never forsook her,
perceiving that she had carcasses sufficient to complete her
oblation, commanded the chains to be stretched across the
staircase, and the iron doors barricadoed, that no more might
come up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
No sooner were these orders obeyed, than the tower shook;
the dead bodies vanished in the flames, which at once changed
from a swarthy crimson to a bright rose colour; an ambient
vapour emitted the most exquisite fragrance; the marble
columns rang with harmonious sounds, and the liquefied horns
diffused a delicious perfume. Carathis, in transports, anticipated
the success of her enterprise; whilst her mutes and
negresses, to whom these sweets had given the colic, retired
grumbling to their cells.</p>

<p>Scarcely were they gone, when, instead of the pile, horns,
mummies, and ashes, the caliph both saw and felt, with a
degree of pleasure which he could not express, a table covered
with the most magnificent repast: flagons of wine and vases
of exquisite sherbet reposing on snow.<a href="#Note_219a" name="Note_27" id="Note_27" class="nanchor">*</a> He availed himself,
without scruple, of such an entertainment; and had already
laid hands on a lamb stuffed with pistachios, whilst Carathis
was privately drawing from a filigree urn a parchment<a href="#Note_219b" name="Note_28" id="Note_28" class="nanchor">*</a> that
seemed to be endless, and which had escaped the notice of her
son. Totally occupied in gratifying an importunate appetite,
he left her to peruse it without interruption; which having
finished, she said to him, in an authoritative tone, “Put an
end to your gluttony, and hear the splendid promises with
which you are favoured!” She then read as follows: “Vathek,
my well-beloved, thou hast surpassed my hopes: my nostrils
have been regaled by the savour of thy mummies, thy horns,
and, still more, by the lives devoted on the pile. At the full
of the moon, cause the bands of thy musicians, and thy timbals,
to be heard; depart from thy palace, surrounded by all the
pageants of majesty&mdash;thy most faithful slaves, thy best beloved
wives, thy most magnificent litters, thy richest loaden camels&mdash;and
set forward on thy way to Istakhar.<a href="#Note_219c" name="Note_29" id="Note_29" class="nanchor">*</a> There I await thy
coming: that is the region of wonders: there shalt thou receive
the diadem of Gian Ben Gian,<a href="#Note_219d" name="Note_30" id="Note_30" class="nanchor">*</a> the talismans of Soliman,<a href="#Note_219e" name="Note_31" id="Note_31" class="nanchor">*</a> and
the treasures of the pre-Adamite sultans:<a href="#Note_219f" name="Note_32" id="Note_32" class="nanchor">*</a> there shalt thou be
solaced with all kinds of delight.&mdash;But beware how thou enterest
any dwelling<a href="#Note_219g" name="Note_33" id="Note_33" class="nanchor">*</a> on thy route; or thou shalt feel the effects of
my anger.”</p>

<p>The caliph, notwithstanding his habitual luxury, had never
before dined with so much satisfaction. He gave full scope to
the joy of these golden tidings, and betook himself to drinking
anew. Carathis, whose antipathy to wine was by no means
insuperable, failed not to pledge him at every bumper he
ironically quaffed to the health of Mahomet. This infernal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
liquor completed their impious temerity, and prompted them
to utter a profusion of blasphemies. They gave a loose to
their wit, at the expense of the ass of Balaam, the dog of the
seven sleepers, and the other animals admitted into the paradise
of Mahomet.<a href="#Note_220a" name="Note_34" id="Note_34" class="nanchor">*</a> In this sprightly humour, they descended the
fifteen hundred stairs, diverting themselves, as they went, at
the anxious faces they saw on the square, through the barbacans
and loopholes of the tower; and at length arrived at the royal
apartments, by the subterranean passage. Bababalouk was
parading to and fro, and issuing his mandates with great pomp
to the eunuchs, who were snuffing the lights and painting the
eyes of the Circassians. No sooner did he catch sight of the
caliph and his mother, than he exclaimed, “Hah! you have
then, I perceive, escaped from the flames; I was not, however,
altogether out of doubt.”&mdash;“Of what moment is it to us what
you thought or think?” cried Carathis: “go, speed, tell Morakanabad
that we immediately want him; and take care not to
stop by the way to make your insipid reflections.”</p>

<p>Morakanabad delayed not to obey the summons, and was
received by Vathek and his mother with great solemnity.
They told him, with an air of composure and commiseration,
that the fire at the top of the tower was extinguished; but
that it had cost the lives of the brave people who sought to
assist them.</p>

<p>“Still more misfortunes!” cried Morakanabad, with a sigh.
“Ah, commander of the faithful, our holy Prophet is certainly
irritated against us! it behoves you to appease him.” “We
will appease him hereafter,” replied the caliph, with a smile
that augured nothing of good. “You will have leisure sufficient
for your supplications during my absence, for this country is
the bane of my health. I am disgusted with the mountain of
the four fountains, and am resolved to go and drink of the
stream of Rocnabad.<a href="#Note_220b" name="Note_35" id="Note_35" class="nanchor">*</a> I long to refresh myself in the delightful
valleys which it waters. Do you, with the advice of my mother,
govern<a href="#Note_220c" name="Note_36" id="Note_36" class="nanchor">*</a> my dominions, and take care to supply whatever her
experiments may demand; for you well know that our tower
abounds in materials for the advancement of science.”</p>

<p>The tower but ill suited Morakanabad’s taste. Immense
treasures had been lavished upon it; and nothing had he ever
seen carried thither but female negroes, mutes, and abominable
drugs. Nor did he know well what to think of Carathis, who,
like a chameleon, could assume all possible colours. Her
cursed eloquence had often driven the poor Mussulman to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
last shifts. He considered, however, that if she possessed but
few good qualities, her son had still fewer; and that the alternative,
on the whole, would be in her favour. Consoled, therefore,
with this reflection, he went, in good spirits, to soothe the
populace, and make the proper arrangements for his master’s
journey.</p>

<p>Vathek, to conciliate the spirits of the subterranean palace,
resolved that his expedition should be uncommonly splendid.
With this view he confiscated, on all sides, the property of his
subjects; whilst his worthy mother stripped the seraglios she
visited of the gems they contained. She collected all the
sempstresses and embroiderers of Samarah and other cities, to
the distance of sixty leagues, to prepare pavilions, palanquins,
sofas, canopies, and litters for the train of the monarch. There
was not left, in Masulipatan, a single piece of chintz; and so
much muslin<a href="#Note_221a" name="Note_37" id="Note_37" class="nanchor">*</a> had been brought up to dress out Bababalouk
and the other black eunuchs, that there remained not an ell
of it in the whole Irak of Babylon.</p>

<p>During these preparations, Carathis, who never lost sight of
her great object, which was to obtain favour with the powers
of darkness, made select parties of the fairest and most delicate
ladies of the city; but in the midst of their gaiety, she contrived
to introduce vipers amongst them, and to break pots of scorpions
under the table. They all bit to a wonder; and Carathis would
have left her friends to die, were it not that, to fill up the time,
she now and then amused herself in curing their wounds, with
an excellent anodyne of her own invention; for this good princess
abhorred being indolent.</p>

<p>Vathek, who was not altogether so active as his mother,
devoted his time to the sole gratification of his senses, in the
palaces which were severally dedicated to them. He disgusted
himself no more with the divan, or the mosque. One half of
Samarah followed his example, whilst the other lamented the
progress of corruption.</p>

<p>In the midst of these transactions, the embassy returned,
which had been sent, in pious times, to Mecca. It consisted
of the most reverend mullahs,<a href="#Note_221b" name="Note_38" id="Note_38" class="nanchor">*</a> who had fulfilled their commission
and brought back one of those precious besoms which
are used to sweep the sacred Caaba;<a href="#Note_221c" name="Note_39" id="Note_39" class="nanchor">*</a> a present truly worthy
of the greatest potentate on earth!</p>

<p>The caliph happened at this instant to be engaged in an
apartment by no means adapted to the reception of embassies.
He heard the voice of Bababalouk, calling out from between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
door and the tapestry that hung before it, “Here are the
excellent Edris al Shafei, and the seraphic Al Mouhateddin, who
have brought the besom from Mecca, and, with tears of joy,
entreat they may present it to your majesty in person.”&mdash;“Let
them bring the besom hither; it may be of use,” said Vathek.&mdash;“How!”
answered Bababalouk, half aloud and amazed.&mdash;“Obey,”
replied the caliph, “for it is my sovereign will; go
instantly, vanish! for here will I receive the good folk who have
thus filled thee with joy.”</p>

<p>The eunuch departed muttering, and bade the venerable
train attend him. A sacred rapture was diffused amongst these
reverend old men. Though fatigued with the length of their
expedition, they followed Bababalouk with an alertness almost
miraculous, and felt themselves highly flattered, as they swept
along the stately porticoes, that the caliph would not receive
them like ambassadors in ordinary in his hall of audience.
Soon reaching the interior of the harem (where, through blinds
of Persian, they perceived large soft eyes, dark and blue, that
came and went like lightning), penetrated with respect and
wonder, and full of their celestial mission, they advanced
in procession towards the small corridors that appeared to
terminate in nothing, but, nevertheless, led to the cell where
the caliph expected their coming.</p>

<p>“What! is the commander of the faithful sick?” said Edris
al Shafei in a low voice to his companion.&mdash;“I rather think
he is in his oratory,” answered Al Mouhateddin. Vathek, who
heard the dialogue, cried out, “What imports it you, how I
am employed? approach without delay.” They advanced,
whilst the caliph, without showing himself, put forth his hand
from behind the tapestry that hung before the door, and
demanded of them the besom. Having prostrated themselves
as well as the corridor would permit, and even in a tolerable
semicircle, the venerable Al Shafei, drawing forth the besom
from the embroidered and perfumed scarves in which it had
been enveloped and secured from the profane gaze of vulgar
eyes, arose from his associates, and advanced, with an air of
the most awful solemnity, towards the supposed oratory;<a href="#Note_222a" name="Note_40" id="Note_40" class="nanchor">*</a> but
with what astonishment! with what horror was he seized!
Vathek, bursting out into a villainous laugh, snatched the
besom from his trembling hand, and, fixing upon some cobwebs,
that hung from the ceiling, gravely brushed them away till not
a single one remained. The old men, overpowered with amazement,
were unable to lift their beards from the ground; for, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Vathek had carelessly left the tapestry between them half
drawn, they were witnesses of the whole transaction. Their
tears bedewed the marble. Al Mouhateddin swooned through
mortification and fatigue, whilst the caliph, throwing himself
backward on his seat, shouted and clapped his hands without
mercy. At last, addressing himself to Bababalouk, “My dear
black,” said he, “go, regale these pious poor souls with my good
wine from Schiraz,<a href="#Note_223a" name="Note_41" id="Note_41" class="nanchor">*</a> since they can boast of having seen more of
my palace than any one besides.” Having said this, he threw
the besom in their face, and went to enjoy the laugh with
Carathis. Bababalouk did all in his power to console the
ambassadors; but the two most infirm expired on the spot:
the rest were carried to their beds, from whence, being heart-broken
with sorrow and shame, they never arose.</p>

<p>The succeeding night, Vathek, attended by his mother,
ascended the tower to see if everything were ready for his
journey; for he had great faith in the influence of the stars.
The planets appeared in their most favourable aspects. The
caliph, to enjoy so flattering a sight, supped gaily on the roof;
and fancied that he heard, during his repast, loud shouts of
laughter resound through the sky, in a manner that inspired the
fullest assurance.</p>

<p>All was in motion at the palace; lights were kept burning
through the whole of the night: the sound of implements, and
of artisans finishing their work; the voices of women, and their
guardians, who sung at their embroidery; all conspired to interrupt
the stillness of nature, and infinitely delighted the heart of
Vathek, who imagined himself going in triumph to sit upon the
throne of Soliman. The people were not less satisfied than
himself: all assisted to accelerate the moment which should
rescue them from the wayward caprices of so extravagant a
master.</p>

<p>The day preceding the departure of this infatuated prince
was employed by Carathis in repeating to him the decrees of
the mysterious parchment, which she had thoroughly gotten
by heart; and in recommending him not to enter the habitation
of any one by the way:&mdash;“For well thou knowest,” added she,
“how liquorish thy taste is after good dishes and young damsels:
let me, therefore, enjoin thee to be content with thy old cooks,
who are the best in the world; and not to forget that, in thy
ambulatory seraglio, there are at least three dozen of pretty
faces which Bababalouk has not yet unveiled. I myself
have a great desire to watch over thy conduct, and visit the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
subterranean palace, which, no doubt, contains whatever can
interest persons like us. There is nothing so pleasing as retiring
to caverns: my taste for dead bodies, and everything like
mummy, is decided; and, I am confident, thou wilt see the most
exquisite of their kind. Forget me not then, but the moment
thou art in possession of the talismans which are to open the
way to the mineral kingdoms and the centre of the earth itself,
fail not to dispatch some trusty genius to take me and my
cabinet; for the oil of the serpents I have pinched to death will
be a pretty present to the Giaour, who cannot but be charmed
with such dainties.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had Carathis ended this edifying discourse, when
the sun, setting behind the mountain of the four fountains, gave
place to the rising moon. This planet, being that evening at
full, appeared of unusual beauty and magnitude in the eyes of
the women, the eunuchs, and the pages, who were all impatient
to set forward. The city re-echoed with shouts of joy and
flourishing of trumpets. Nothing was visible but plumes
nodding on pavilions, and aigrets shining in the mild lustre
of the moon. The spacious square resembled an immense
parterre variegated with the most stately tulips of the East.<a href="#Note_224a" name="Note_42" id="Note_42" class="nanchor">*</a></p>

<p>Arrayed in the robes which were only worn at the most
distinguished ceremonials, and supported by his vizier and
Bababalouk, the caliph descended the great staircase of the
tower in the sight of all his people. He could not forbear
pausing, at intervals, to admire the superb appearance which
everywhere courted his view; whilst the whole multitude,
even to the camels with their sumptuous burdens, knelt down
before him. For some time a general stillness prevailed, which
nothing happened to disturb but the shrill screams of some
eunuchs in the rear. These vigilant guards, having remarked
certain cages of the ladies<a href="#Note_224b" name="Note_43" id="Note_43" class="nanchor">*</a> swagging somewhat awry, and discovered
that a few adventurous gallants had contrived to get
in, soon dislodged<a href="#Note_224c" name="Note_44" id="Note_44" class="nanchor">*</a> the enraptured culprits, and consigned them,
with good commendations, to the surgeons of the serail. The
majesty of so magnificent a spectacle was not, however, violated
by incidents like these. Vathek, meanwhile, saluted the moon
with an idolatrous air, that neither pleased Morakanabad, nor
the doctors of the law, any more than the viziers and grandees
of his court, who were all assembled to enjoy the last view of
their sovereign.</p>

<p>At length, the clarions and trumpets from the top of the
tower announced the prelude of departure. Though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
instruments were in unison with each other, yet a singular
dissonance was blended with their sounds. This proceeded
from Carathis, who was singing her direful orisons to the Giaour,
whilst the negresses and mutes supplied thorough-bass, without
articulating a word. The good Mussulmans fancied that they
heard the sullen hum of those nocturnal insects which presage
evil,<a href="#Note_225a" name="Note_45" id="Note_45" class="nanchor">*</a> and importuned Vathek to beware how he ventured his
sacred person.</p>

<p>On a given signal, the great standard of the Califat was
displayed: twenty thousand lances shone around it; and the
caliph, treading royally on the cloth of gold which had been
spread for his feet, ascended his litter amidst the general
acclamations of his subjects.</p>

<p>The expedition commenced with the utmost order, and so
entire a silence, that even the locusts were heard from the
thickets on the plain of Catoul.<a href="#Note_225b" name="Note_46" id="Note_46" class="nanchor">*</a> Gaiety and good humour
prevailing, they made full six leagues before the dawn; and
the morning star was still glittering in the firmament, when
the whole of this numerous train had halted on the banks of
the Tigris, where they encamped to repose for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The three days that followed were spent in the same manner;
but on the fourth the heavens looked angry: lightnings broke
forth in frequent flashes; re-echoing peals of thunder succeeded;
and the trembling Circassians clung with all their might to
their ugly guardians. The caliph himself was greatly inclined
to take shelter in the large town of Ghulchissar, the governor
of which came forth to meet him, and tendered every kind of
refreshment the place could supply. But, having examined his
tablets, he suffered the rain to soak him almost to the bone,
notwithstanding the importunity of his first favourites. Though
he began to regret the palace of the senses, yet he lost not
sight of his enterprise, and his sanguine expectation confirmed
his resolution. His geographers were ordered to attend him;
but the weather proved so terrible that these poor people
exhibited a lamentable appearance: and their maps of the
different countries, spoiled by the rain, were in a still worse
plight than themselves. As no long journey had been undertaken
since the time of Haroun al Raschid, every one was
ignorant which way to turn; and Vathek, though well versed
in the course of the heavens, no longer knew his situation on
earth. He thundered even louder than the elements; and
muttered forth certain hints of the bow-string, which were not
very soothing to literary ears. Disgusted at the toilsome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
weariness of the way, he determined to cross over the craggy
heights and follow the guidance of a peasant, who undertook to
bring him in four days to Rocnabad. Remonstrances were all
to no purpose: his resolution was fixed.</p>

<p>The females and eunuchs uttered shrill wailings at the sight
of the precipices below them, and the dreary prospects that
opened in the vast gorges of the mountains. Before they
could reach the ascent of the steepest rock, night overtook
them, and a boisterous tempest arose, which, having rent the
awnings of the palanquins and cages, exposed to the raw gusts
the poor ladies within, who had never before felt so piercing a
cold. The dark clouds that overcast the face of the sky
deepened the horrors of this disastrous night, insomuch that
nothing could be heard distinctly but the mewling of pages
and lamentations of sultanas.</p>

<p>To increase the general misfortune, the frightful uproar of
wild beasts resounded at a distance; and there were soon perceived
in the forest they were skirting the glaring of eyes, which
could belong only to devils or tigers. The pioneers, who, as
well as they could, had marked out a track, and a part of the
advanced guard, were devoured before they had been in the
least apprised of their danger. The confusion that prevailed
was extreme. Wolves, tigers, and other carnivorous animals,
invited by the howling of their companions, flocked together
from every quarter. The crashing of bones was heard on all
sides, and a fearful rush of wings overhead; for now vultures
also began to be of the party.</p>

<p>The terror at length reached the main body of the troops
which surrounded the monarch and his harem at the distance
of two leagues from the scene. Vathek (voluptuously reposed
in his capacious litter upon cushions of silk, with two little
pages<a href="#Note_226a" name="Note_47" id="Note_47" class="nanchor">*</a> beside him of complexions more fair than the enamel
of Franguestan, who were occupied in keeping off flies) was
soundly asleep, and contemplating in his dreams the treasures
of Soliman. The shrieks, however, of his wives awoke him
with a start; and, instead of the Giaour with his key of gold,
he beheld Bababalouk full of consternation. “Sire,” exclaimed
this good servant of the most potent of monarchs, “misfortune
is arrived at its height; wild beasts, who entertain no more
reverence for your sacred person than for a dead ass, have beset
your camels and their drivers; thirty of the most richly laden
are already become their prey, as well as your confectioners,
your cooks,<a href="#Note_226b" name="Note_48" id="Note_48" class="nanchor">*</a> and purveyors; and unless our holy Prophet should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
protect us, we shall have all eaten our last meal.” At the
mention of eating, the caliph lost all patience. He began to
bellow, and even beat himself (for there was no seeing in the
dark). The rumour every instant increased; and Bababalouk,
finding no good could be done with his master, stopped both
his ears against the hurlyburly of the harem, and called out
aloud, “Come, ladies and brothers! all hands to work: strike
light in a moment! never shall it be said, that the commander
of the faithful served to regale these infidel brutes.” Though
there wanted not, in this bevy of beauties, a sufficient number
of capricious and wayward, yet, on the present occasion, they
were all compliance. Fires were visible, in a twinkling, in all
their cages. Ten thousand torches were lighted at once. The
caliph himself seized a large one of wax; every person followed
his example; and by kindling ropes’ ends, dipped in oil and
fastened on poles, an amazing blaze was spread. The rocks
were covered with the splendour of sunshine. The trails of
sparks, wafted by the wind, communicated to the dry fern,
of which there was plenty. Serpents were observed to crawl
forth from their retreats, with amazement and hissings; whilst
the horses snorted, stamped the ground, tossed their noses in
the air, and plunged about without mercy.</p>

<p>One of the forests of cedar that bordered their way took
fire; and the branches that overhung the path, extending their
flames to the muslins and chintzes which covered the cages of
the ladies, obliged them to jump out, at the peril of their necks.
Vathek, who vented on the occasion a thousand blasphemies,
was himself compelled to touch, with his sacred feet, the naked
earth.</p>

<p>Never had such an incident happened before. Full of
mortification, shame, and despondence, and not knowing how
to walk, the ladies fell into the dirt. “Must I go on foot?”
said one. “Must I wet my feet?” cried another. “Must I
soil my dress?” asked a third. “Execrable Bababalouk!”
exclaimed all. “Outcast of hell! what hast thou to do with
torches? Better were it to be eaten by tigers, than to fall
into our present condition! we are for ever undone! Not a
porter is there in the army, nor a currier of camels, but hath
seen some part of our bodies; and, what is worse, our very
faces!”<a href="#Note_227a" name="Note_49" id="Note_49" class="nanchor">*</a> On saying this the most bashful amongst them hid
their foreheads on the ground, whilst such as had more boldness
flew at Bababalouk; but he, well apprised of their humour, and
not wanting in shrewdness, betook himself to his heels along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
with his comrades, all dropping their torches and striking
their timbals.</p>

<p>It was not less light than in the brightest of the dog-days,
and the weather was hot in proportion; but how degrading was
the spectacle, to behold the caliph bespattered, like an ordinary
mortal! As the exercise of his faculties seemed to be suspended,
one of his Ethiopian wives (for he delighted in variety) clasped
him in her arms, threw him upon her shoulder like a sack of
dates, and, finding that the fire was hemming them in, set off
with no small expedition, considering the weight of her burden.
The other ladies, who had just learned the use of their feet,
followed her; their guards galloped after; and the camel-drivers
brought up the rear, as fast as their charge would permit.</p>

<p>They soon reached the spot where the wild beasts had commenced
the carnage, but which they had too much good sense
not to leave at the approaching of the tumult, having made
besides a most luxurious supper. Bababalouk, nevertheless,
seized on a few of the plumpest, which were unable to budge
from the place, and began to flay them with admirable adroitness.
The cavalcade having proceeded so far from the conflagration
that the heat felt rather grateful than violent, it was
immediately resolved on to halt. The tattered chintzes were
picked up; the scraps, left by the wolves and tigers, interred;
and vengeance was taken on some dozens of vultures, that were
too much glutted to rise on the wing. The camels, which had
been left unmolested to make sal ammoniac, being numbered,
and the ladies once more enclosed in their cages, the imperial
tent was pitched on the levellest ground they could find.</p>

<p>Vathek, reposing upon a mattress of down, and tolerably
recovered from the jolting of the Ethiopian, who, to his feelings,
seemed the roughest trotting jade he had hitherto mounted,
called out for something to eat. But, alas! those delicate cakes
which had been baked in silver ovens for his royal mouth, those
rich manchets, amber comfits, flagons of Schiraz wine, porcelain
vases of snow, and grapes from the banks of the Tigris,<a href="#Note_228a" name="Note_50" id="Note_50" class="nanchor">*</a> were all
irremediably lost! And nothing had Bababalouk to present
in their stead but a roasted wolf, vultures <i>à la daube</i>, aromatic
herbs of the most acrid poignancy, rotten truffles, boiled thistles,
and such other wild plants as much ulcerate the throat and
parch up the tongue. Nor was he better provided in the article
of drink; for he could procure nothing to accompany these
irritating viands but a few phials of abominable brandy which
had been secreted by the scullions in their slippers. Vathek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
made wry faces at so savage a repast, and Bababalouk answered
them with shrugs and contortions. The caliph, however, ate
with tolerable appetite, and fell into a nap that lasted six
hours.</p>

<p>The splendour of the sun, reflected from the white cliffs of
the mountains, in spite of the curtains that enclosed Vathek,
at length disturbed his repose. He awoke terrified, and stung
to the quick by wormwood-colour flies, which emitted from
their wings a suffocating stench. The miserable monarch was
perplexed how to act, though his wits were not idle in seeking
expedients; whilst Bababalouk lay snoring amidst a swarm of
those insects that busily thronged to pay court to his nose.
The little pages, famished with hunger, had dropped their fans
on the ground, and exerted their dying voices in bitter reproaches
on the caliph, who now, for the first time, heard the language
of truth.</p>

<p>Thus stimulated, he renewed his imprecations against the
Giaour, and bestowed upon Mahomet some soothing expressions.
“Where am I?” cried he: “what are these dreadful rocks&mdash;these
valleys of darkness? Are we arrived at the horrible Kaf?<a href="#Note_229a" name="Note_51" id="Note_51" class="nanchor">*</a>
Is the Simurgh<a href="#Note_229b" name="Note_52" id="Note_52" class="nanchor">*</a> coming to pluck out my eyes, as a punishment
for undertaking this impious enterprise?” Having said this
he turned himself towards an outlet in the side of his pavilion;
but, alas! what objects occurred to his view? on one side a
plain of black sand that appeared to be unbounded; and, on
the other, perpendicular crags, bristled over with those abominable
thistles which had so severely lacerated his tongue. He
fancied, however, that he perceived amongst the brambles and
briars some gigantic flowers, but was mistaken; for these were
only the dangling palampores<a href="#Note_229c" name="Note_53" id="Note_53" class="nanchor">*</a> and variegated tatters of his gay
retinue. As there were several clefts in the rock from whence
water seemed to have flowed, Vathek applied his ear with the
hope of catching the sound of some latent torrent; but could
only distinguish the low murmurs of his people, who were
repining at their journey, and complaining for the want of
water. “To what purpose,” asked they, “have we been
brought hither? hath our caliph another tower to build? or
have the relentless afrits,<a href="#Note_229d" name="Note_54" id="Note_54" class="nanchor">*</a> whom Carathis so much loves, fixed
their abode in this place?”</p>

<p>At the name of Carathis, Vathek recollected the tablets he
had received from his mother, who assured him they were
fraught with preternatural qualities,<a href="#Note_229e" name="Note_55" id="Note_55" class="nanchor">*</a> and advised him to consult
them as emergencies might require. Whilst he was engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in turning them over, he heard a shout of joy and a loud
clapping of hands. The curtains of his pavilion were soon
drawn back, and he beheld Bababalouk, followed by a troop
of his favourites, conducting two dwarfs,<a href="#Note_230a" name="Note_56" id="Note_56" class="nanchor">*</a> each a cubit high;
who had brought between them a large basket of melons,
oranges, and pomegranates. They were singing in the sweetest
tones the words that follow: “We dwell on the top of these
rocks, in a cabin of rushes and canes; the eagles envy us our
nest: a small spring supplies us with water for the Abdest, and
we daily repeat prayers,<a href="#Note_230b" name="Note_57" id="Note_57" class="nanchor">*</a> which the Prophet approves. We
love you, O commander of the faithful! our master, the good
Emir Fakreddin, loves you also: he reveres, in your person, the
vicegerent of Mahomet. Little as we are, in us he confides: he
knows our hearts to be as good as our bodies are contemptible;
and hath placed us here to aid those who are bewildered on
these dreary mountains. Last night, whilst we were occupied
within our cell in reading the holy Koran,<a href="#Note_230c" name="Note_58" id="Note_58" class="nanchor">*</a> a sudden hurricane
blew out our lights, and rocked our habitation. For two
whole hours, palpable darkness prevailed; but we heard sounds
at a distance, which we conjectured to proceed from the bells
of a cafila,<a href="#Note_230d" name="Note_59" id="Note_59" class="nanchor">*</a> passing over the rocks. Our ears were soon filled
with deplorable shrieks, frightful roarings, and the sound of
timbals. Chilled with terror, we concluded that the Deggial,<a href="#Note_230e" name="Note_60" id="Note_60" class="nanchor">*</a>
with his exterminating angels, had sent forth his plagues on the
earth. In the midst of these melancholy reflections, we perceived
flames of the deepest red glow in the horizon; and found
ourselves, in a few moments, covered with flakes of fire. Amazed
at so strange an appearance, we took up the volume dictated by
the blessed Intelligence,<a href="#Note_230f" name="Note_61" id="Note_61" class="nanchor">*</a> and, kneeling, by the light of the fire
that surrounded us, we recited the verse which says, ‘Put no
trust in any thing but the mercy of Heaven: there is no help,
save in the holy Prophet: the mountain of Kaf itself may
tremble; it is the power of Allah only that cannot be moved.’
After having pronounced these words, we felt consolation, and
our minds were hushed into a sacred repose. Silence ensued,
and our ears clearly distinguished a voice in the air, saying:
‘Servants of my faithful servant! go down to the happy valley
of Fakreddin: tell him that an illustrious opportunity now
offers to satiate the thirst of his hospitable heart. The commander
of true believers is, this day, bewildered amongst these
mountains, and stands in need of thy aid.’&mdash;We obeyed with
joy the angelic mission; and our master, filled with pious zeal,
hath culled with his own hands these melons, oranges, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
pomegranates. He is following us, with a hundred dromedaries,
laden with the purest waters of his fountains; and is coming to
kiss the fringe of your consecrated robe,<a href="#Note_231a" name="Note_62" id="Note_62" class="nanchor">*</a> and implore you to
enter his humble habitation,<a href="#Note_231b" name="Note_63" id="Note_63" class="nanchor">*</a> which, placed amidst these barren
wilds, resembles an emerald set in lead.” The dwarfs, having
ended their address, remained still standing, and, with hands
crossed upon their bosoms, preserved a respectful silence.</p>

<p>Vathek, in the midst of this curious harangue, seized the
basket; and, long before it was finished, the fruits had dissolved
in his mouth. As he continued to eat, his piety increased;
and, in the same breath, he recited his prayers and called
for the Koran and sugar.</p>

<p>Such was the state of his mind when the tablets, which were
thrown by at the approach of the dwarfs, again attracted his
eye. He took them up; but was ready to drop on the ground
when he beheld, in large red characters,<a href="#Note_231c" name="Note_64" id="Note_64" class="nanchor">*</a> inscribed by Carathis,
these words&mdash;which were, indeed, enough to make him tremble:
“Beware of old doctors and their puny messengers of but one
cubit high: distrust their pious frauds; and, instead of eating
their melons, impale on a spit the bearers of them. Shouldest
thou be such a fool as to visit them, the portal of the subterranean
palace will shut in thy face, with such force as shall
shake thee asunder: thy body shall be spit upon,<a href="#Note_231d" name="Note_65" id="Note_65" class="nanchor">*</a> and bats will
nestle in thy belly.”<a href="#Note_231e" name="Note_66" id="Note_66" class="nanchor">*</a></p>

<p>“To what tends this ominous rhapsody?” cries the caliph;
“and must I, then, perish in these deserts with thirst, whilst
I may refresh myself in the delicious valley of melons and
cucumbers? Accursed be the Giaour with his portal of ebony!
he hath made me dance attendance too long already. Besides,
who shall prescribe laws to me? I, forsooth, must not enter
any one’s habitation! Be it so; but what one can I enter that
is not my own?” Bababalouk, who lost not a syllable of this
soliloquy, applauded it with all his heart; and the ladies, for
the first time, agreed with him in opinion.</p>

<p>The dwarfs were entertained, caressed, and seated, with great
ceremony, on little cushions of satin. The symmetry of their
persons was a subject of admiration; not an inch of them was
suffered to pass unexamined. Knick-knacks and dainties were
offered in profusion; but all were declined with respectful
gravity. They climbed up the sides of the caliph’s seat, and,
placing themselves each on one of his shoulders, began to
whisper prayers in his ears. Their tongues quivered like aspen
leaves; and the patience of Vathek was almost exhausted, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the acclamations of the troops announced the approach of
Fakreddin, who was come with a hundred old grey-beards, and
as many Korans and dromedaries. They instantly set about
their ablutions, and began to repeat the Bismillah.<a href="#Note_232a" name="Note_67" id="Note_67" class="nanchor">*</a> Vathek, to
get rid of these officious monitors, followed their example, for
his hands were burning.</p>

<p>The good emir, who was punctiliously religious, and likewise
a great dealer in compliments, made an harangue five times
more prolix and insipid than his little harbingers had already
delivered. The caliph, unable any longer to refrain, exclaimed,
“For the love of Mahomet, my dear Fakreddin, have done! let
us proceed to your valley, and enjoy the fruits that Heaven
hath vouchsafed you.” The hint of proceeding put all into
motion. The venerable attendants of the emir set forward
somewhat slowly, but Vathek having ordered his little pages,
in private, to goad on the dromedaries, loud fits of laughter
broke forth from the cages; for the unwieldy curvetting of these
poor beasts, and the ridiculous distress of their superannuated
riders, afforded the ladies no small entertainment.</p>

<p>They descended, however, unhurt into the valley, by the
easy slopes which the emir had ordered to be cut in the rock;
and already the murmuring of streams and the rustling of
leaves began to catch their attention. The cavalcade soon
entered a path, which was skirted by flowering shrubs, and
extended to a vast wood of palm trees, whose branches overspread
a vast building of freestone. This edifice was crowned
with nine domes, and adorned with as many portals of bronze,
on which was engraven the following inscription:<a href="#Note_232b" name="Note_68" id="Note_68" class="nanchor">*</a> “This is the
asylum of pilgrims, the refuge of travellers, and the depository
of secrets from all parts of the world.”</p>

<p>Nine pages, beautiful as the day, and decently clothed in
robes of Egyptian linen, were standing at each door. They
received the whole retinue with an easy and inviting air. Four
of the most amiable placed the caliph on a magnificent tecthtrevan;<a href="#Note_232c" name="Note_69" id="Note_69" class="nanchor">*</a>
four others, somewhat less graceful, took charge of
Bababalouk, who capered for joy at the snug little cabin that
fell to his share: the pages that remained waited on the rest
of the train.</p>

<p>Every man being gone out of sight, the gate of a large enclosure
on the right turned on its harmonious hinges; and a
young female, of a slender form, came forth. Her light brown
hair floated in the hazy breeze of the twilight. A troop of
young maidens, like the Pleiades, attended her on tiptoe. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
hastened to the pavilions that contained the sultanas; and the
young lady, gracefully bending, said to them, “Charming
princesses! everything is ready; we have prepared beds for
your repose, and strewed your apartments with jasmine. No
insects will keep off slumber from visiting your eyelids; we will
dispel them with a thousand plumes. Come, then, amiable
ladies! refresh your delicate feet and your ivory limbs<a href="#Note_233a" name="Note_70" id="Note_70" class="nanchor">*</a> in
baths of rose water;<a href="#Note_233b" name="Note_71" id="Note_71" class="nanchor">*</a> and, by the light of perfumed lamps, your
servants will amuse you with tales.” The sultanas accepted
with pleasure these obliging offers, and followed the young
lady to the emir’s harem; where we must, for a moment, leave
them and return to the caliph.</p>

<p>Vathek found himself beneath a vast dome, illuminated by
a thousand lamps of rock crystal: as many vases of the same
material, filled with excellent sherbet, sparkled on a large table,
where a profusion of viands were spread. Amongst others,
were rice boiled in milk of almonds, saffron soups, and lamb
<i>à la crême</i>;<a href="#Note_233c" name="Note_72" id="Note_72" class="nanchor">*</a> of all which the caliph was amazingly fond. He
took of each as much as he was able; testified his sense of the
emir’s friendship by the gaiety of his heart; and made the
dwarfs dance against their will,<a href="#Note_233d" name="Note_73" id="Note_73" class="nanchor">*</a> for these little devotees durst
not refuse the commander of the faithful.<a href="#Note_233e" name="Note_74" id="Note_74" class="nanchor">*</a> At last, he spread
himself on the sofa, and slept sounder than he ever had before.</p>

<p>Beneath this dome a general silence prevailed; for there was
nothing to disturb it but the jaws of Bababalouk, who had
untrussed himself to eat with greater advantage, being anxious
to make amends for his fast in the mountains. As his spirits
were too high to admit of his sleeping, and hating to be idle,
he proposed with himself to visit the harem, and repair to his
charge of the ladies: to examine if they had been properly
lubricated with the balm of Mecca; if their eyebrows and tresses
were in order; and, in a word, to perform all the little offices
they might need. He sought for a long time together, but
without being able to find out the door. He durst not speak
aloud, for fear of disturbing the caliph; and not a soul was
stirring in the precincts of the palace. He almost despaired
of effecting his purpose, when a low whispering just reached
his ear. It came from the dwarfs, who were returned to their
old occupation, and, for the nine hundred and ninety-ninth
time<a href="#Note_233f" name="Note_75" id="Note_75" class="nanchor">*</a> in their lives, were reading over the Koran. They very
politely invited Bababalouk to be of their party; but his head
was full of other concerns. The dwarfs, though not a little
scandalized at his dissolute morals, directed him to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
apartments he wanted to find. His way thither lay through a
hundred dark corridors, along which he groped as he went, and
at last began to catch, from the extremity of a passage, the
charming gossiping of the women, which not a little delighted his
heart. “Ah, ha! what, not yet asleep?” cried he; and, taking
long strides as he spoke, “did you not suspect me of abjuring
my charge?” Two of the black eunuchs, on hearing a voice so
loud, left their party in haste, sabre in hand,<a href="#Note_234a" name="Note_76" id="Note_76" class="nanchor">*</a> to discover the
cause; but presently was repeated on all sides, “’Tis only
Bababalouk! no one but Bababalouk!” This circumspect
guardian, having gone up to a thin veil of carnation-colour
silk that hung before the doorway, distinguished, by means
of the softened splendour that shone through it, an oval
bath of dark porphyry, surrounded by curtains, festooned
in large folds. Through the apertures between them, as they
were not drawn close, groups of young slaves were visible;
amongst whom Bababalouk perceived his pupils, indulgingly
expanding their arms, as if to embrace the perfumed water
and refresh themselves after their fatigues. The looks of
tender languor; their confidential whispers, and the enchanting
smiles with which they were imparted; the exquisite fragrance
of the roses: all combined to inspire a voluptuousness, which
even Bababalouk himself was scarce able to withstand.</p>

<p>He summoned up, however, his usual solemnity; and, in
the peremptory tone of authority, commanded the ladies
instantly to leave the bath. Whilst he was issuing these
mandates, the young Nouronihar, daughter of the emir, who
was as sprightly as an antelope, and full of wanton gaiety,
beckoned one of her slaves to let down the great swing<a href="#Note_234b" name="Note_77" id="Note_77" class="nanchor">*</a> which
was suspended to the ceiling by cords of silk; and whilst this
was doing, winked to her companions in the bath, who,
chagrined to be forced from so soothing a state of indolence,
began to twist and entangle their hair to plague and detain
Bababalouk, and teased him, besides, with a thousand vagaries.</p>

<p>Nouronihar, perceiving that he was nearly out of patience,
accosted him, with an arch air of respectful concern, and said,
“My lord! it is not by any means decent that the chief eunuch
of the caliph, our sovereign, should thus continue standing;
deign but to recline your graceful person upon this sofa, which
will burst with vexation if it have not the honour to receive
you.” Caught by these flattering accents, Bababalouk gallantly
replied, “Delight of the apple of my eye! I accept
the invitation of your honeyed lips; and, to say truth, my senses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
are dazzled with the radiance that beams from your charms.”&mdash;“Repose,
then, at your ease,” replied the beauty, as she
placed him on the pretended sofa, which, quicker than lightning,
flew up all at once. The rest of the women, having aptly conceived
her design, sprang naked from the bath, and plied the
swing with such unmerciful jerks that it swept through the
whole compass of a very lofty dome, and took from the poor
victim all power of respiration. Sometimes his feet razed
the surface of the water; and, at others, the skylight almost
flattened his nose. In vain did he fill the air with the cries
of a voice that resembled the ringing of a cracked jar; the
peals of laughter were still predominant.</p>

<p>Nouronihar, in the inebriety of youthful spirits, being used
only to eunuchs of ordinary harems, and having never seen
anything so eminently disgusting, was far more diverted than
all the rest. She began to parody some Persian verses, and
sang, with an accent most demurely piquant, “Oh, gentle
white dove! as thou soar’st through the air, vouchsafe one kind
glance on the mate of thy love: melodious Philomel, I am thy
rose;<a href="#Note_235a" name="Note_78" id="Note_78" class="nanchor">*</a> warble some couplet to ravish my heart!”</p>

<p>The sultanas and their slaves, stimulated by these pleasantries,
persevered at the swing with such unremitted assiduity, that at
length the cord which had secured it snapped suddenly asunder;
and Bababalouk fell, floundering like a turtle, to the bottom of
the bath. This accident occasioned an universal shout. Twelve
little doors, till now unobserved, flew open at once; and the
ladies, in an instant, made their escape; but not before having
heaped all the towels on his head, and put out the lights that
remained.</p>

<p>The deplorable animal, in water to the chin, overwhelmed
with darkness, and unable to extricate himself from the wrappers
that embarrassed him, was still doomed to hear, for his further
consolation, the fresh bursts of merriment his disaster occasioned.
He bustled, but in vain, to get from the bath; for the margin was
become so slippery with the oil spilt in breaking the lamps,
that, at every effort, he slid back with a plunge which resounded
aloud through the hollow of the dome. These cursed peals
of laughter were redoubled at every relapse, and he, who thought
the place infested rather by devils than women, resolved to
cease groping, and abide in the bath; where he amused himself
with soliloquies, interspersed with imprecations, of which his
malicious neighbours, reclining on down, suffered not an accent
to escape. In this delectable plight the morning surprised him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The caliph, wondering at his absence, had caused him to be
sought for everywhere. At last he was drawn forth almost
smothered from under the wisp of linen, and wet even to the
marrow. Limping, and his teeth chattering with cold, he
approached his master, who inquired what was the matter,
and how he came soused in so strange a pickle.&mdash;“And why
did you enter this cursed lodge?” answered Bababalouk
gruffly. “Ought a monarch like you to visit with his harem
the abode of a grey-bearded emir, who knows nothing of life?&mdash;And
with what gracious damsels doth the place too abound!
Fancy to yourself how they have soaked me like a burnt crust;
and made me dance like a jack-pudding, the livelong night
through, on their damnable swing. What an excellent lesson
for your sultanas, into whom I had instilled such reserve and
decorum!” Vathek, comprehending not a syllable of all this
invective, obliged him to relate minutely the transaction: but,
instead of sympathizing with the miserable sufferer, he laughed
immoderately at the device of the swing and the figure of
Bababalouk mounted upon it. The stung eunuch could scarcely
preserve the semblance of respect. “Ay, laugh, my lord!
laugh,” said he; “but I wish this Nouronihar would play some
trick on you; she is too wicked to spare even majesty itself.”
These words made, for the present, but a slight impression on
the caliph; but they not long after recurred to his mind.</p>

<p>This conversation was cut short by Fakreddin, who came to
request that Vathek would join in the prayers and ablutions,
to be solemnized on a spacious meadow watered by innumerable
streams. The caliph found the waters refreshing, but the
prayers abominably irksome. He diverted himself, however,
with the multitude of calenders,<a href="#Note_236a" name="Note_79" id="Note_79" class="nanchor">*</a>
santons,<a href="#Note_236b" name="Note_80" id="Note_80" class="nanchor">*</a>
and dervishes,<a href="#Note_236c" name="Note_81" id="Note_81" class="nanchor">*</a> who
were continually coming and going; but especially with the
Brahmins,<a href="#Note_236d" name="Note_82" id="Note_82" class="nanchor">*</a>
fakirs,<a href="#Note_236e" name="Note_83" id="Note_83" class="nanchor">*</a> and other enthusiasts, who had travelled from
the heart of India, and halted on their way with the emir.
These latter had each of them some mummery peculiar to himself.
One dragged a huge chain wherever he went; another an
orang-outang; whilst a third was furnished with scourges; and
all performed to a charm. Some would climb up trees, holding
one foot in the air; others poise themselves over a fire, and
without mercy fillip their noses. There were some amongst
them that cherished vermin, which were not ungrateful in
requiting their caresses. These rambling fanatics revolted the
hearts of the dervishes, the calenders, and santons; however,
the vehemence of their aversion soon subsided, under the hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
that the presence of the caliph would cure their folly, and convert
them to the Mussulman faith. But, alas! how great was
their disappointment! for Vathek, instead of preaching to them,
treated them as buffoons, bade them present his compliments
to Visnow and Ixhora,<a href="#Note_237a" name="Note_84" id="Note_84" class="nanchor">*</a> and discovered a predilection for a squat
old man from the Isle of Serendib, who was more ridiculous
than any of the rest. “Come!” said he, “for the love of your
gods, bestow a few slaps on your chops to amuse me.” The
old fellow, offended at such an address, began loudly to weep;
but, as he betrayed a villainous drivelling in shedding tears,
the caliph turned his back and listened to Bababalouk, who
whispered, whilst he held the umbrella over him, “Your
majesty should be cautious of this odd assembly, which hath
been collected I know not for what. Is it necessary to exhibit
such spectacles to a mighty potentate, with interludes of talapoins<a href="#Note_237b" name="Note_85" id="Note_85" class="nanchor">*</a>
more mangy than dogs? Were I you, I would command a
fire to be kindled, and at once rid the estates of the emir, of his
harem, and all his menagerie.”&mdash;“Tush, dolt,” answered Vathek,
“and know that all this infinitely charms me. Nor shall I
leave the meadow till I have visited every hive of these pious
mendicants.”</p>

<p>Wherever the caliph directed his course, objects of pity were
sure to swarm round him; the blind, the purblind, smarts without
noses, damsels without ears, each to extol the munificence
of Fakreddin, who, as well as his attendant grey-beards, dealt
about, gratis, plasters and cataplasms to all that applied. At
noon, a superb corps of cripples made its appearance; and soon
after advanced, by platoons, on the plain, the completest
association of invalids that had ever been embodied till then.
The blind went groping with the blind, the lame limped on
together, and the maimed made gestures to each other with
the only arm that remained. The sides of a considerable waterfall
were crowded by the deaf; amongst whom were some from
Pegû, with ears uncommonly handsome and large, but who
were still less able to hear than the rest. Nor were there wanting
others in abundance with hump-backs, wenny necks, and even
horns of an exquisite polish.</p>

<p>The emir, to aggrandize the solemnity of the festival, in
honour of his illustrious visitant, ordered the turf to be spread
on all sides with skins and table-cloths; upon which were
served up for the good Mussulmans pilaus of every hue, with
other orthodox dishes; and, by the express order of Vathek,
who was shamefully tolerant, small plates of abominations<a href="#Note_237c" name="Note_86" id="Note_86" class="nanchor">*</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
were prepared, to the great scandal of the faithful. The holy
assembly began to fall to. The caliph, in spite of every remonstrance
from the chief of his eunuchs, resolved to have a dinner
dressed on the spot. The complaisant emir immediately gave
orders for a table to be placed in the shade of the willows. The
first service consisted of fish, which they drew from a river<a href="#Note_238a" name="Note_87" id="Note_87" class="nanchor">*</a>
flowing over sands of gold at the foot of a lofty hill. These
were broiled as fast as taken, and served up with a sauce of
vinegar and small herbs that grew on Mount Sinai;<a href="#Note_238b" name="Note_88" id="Note_88" class="nanchor">*</a> for everything
with the emir was excellent and pious.</p>

<p>The dessert was not quite set on, when the sound of lutes
from the hill was repeated by the echoes of the neighbouring
mountains. The caliph, with an emotion of pleasure and
surprise, had no sooner raised up his head, than a handful of
jasmine dropped on his face. An abundance of tittering
succeeded the frolic, and instantly appeared, through the
bushes, the elegant forms of several young females, skipping
and bounding like roes. The fragrance diffused from their
hair struck the sense of Vathek, who, in an ecstasy, suspending
his repast, said to Bababalouk, “Are the peris<a href="#Note_238c" name="Note_89" id="Note_89" class="nanchor">*</a> come down
from their spheres? Note her, in particular, whose form is so
perfect; venturously running on the brink of the precipice, and
turning back her head, as regardless of nothing but the graceful
flow of her robe. With what captivating impatience doth she
contend with the bushes for her veil? could it be she who threw
the jasmine at me?”&mdash;“Ay! she it was; and you too would she
throw, from the top of the rock,” answered Bababalouk, “for
that is my good friend Nouronihar, who so kindly lent me her
swing. My dear lord and master,” added he, wresting a twig
from a willow, “let me correct her for her want of respect: the
emir will have no reason to complain; since (bating what I owe
to his piety) he is much to be blamed for keeping a troop of
girls on the mountains, where the sharpness of the air gives
their blood too brisk a circulation.”</p>

<p>“Peace! blasphemer,” said the caliph; “speak not thus of
her, who, over these mountains, leads my heart a willing captive.
Contrive, rather, that my eyes may be fixed upon hers; that I
may respire her sweet breath as she bounds panting along these
delightful wilds!” On saying these words, Vathek extended
his arms towards the hill; and directing his eyes with an
anxiety unknown to him before, endeavoured to keep within
view the object that enthralled his soul; but her course was
as difficult to follow as the flight of one of those beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
blue butterflies of Cashmere<a href="#Note_239a" name="Note_90" id="Note_90" class="nanchor">*</a> which are at once, so volatile
and rare.</p>

<p>The caliph, not satisfied with seeing, wished also to hear
Nouronihar, and eagerly turned to catch the sound of her
voice. At last, he distinguished her whispering to one of her
companions behind the thicket from whence she had thrown the
jasmine: “A caliph, it must be owned, is a fine thing to see:
but my little Gulchenrouz is much more amiable: one lock of
his hair is of more value to me than the richest embroidery of
the Indies. I had rather that his teeth should mischievously
press my finger, than the richest ring of the imperial treasure.
Where have you left him, Sutlememe? and why is he not here?”</p>

<p>The agitated caliph still wished to hear more; but she immediately
retired with all her attendants. The fond monarch pursued
her with his eyes till she was gone out of sight; and then continued
like a bewildered and benighted traveller, from whom
the clouds had obscured the constellation that guided his way.
The curtain of night seemed dropped before him: everything
appeared discoloured. The falling waters filled his soul with
dejection, and his tears trickled down the jasmines he had
caught from Nouronihar, and placed in his inflamed bosom.
He snatched up a few shining pebbles, to remind him of the
scene where he felt the first tumults of love. Two hours were
elapsed, and evening drew on, before he could resolve to depart
from the place. He often, but in vain, attempted to go: a soft
languor enervated the powers of his mind. Extending himself
on the brink of the stream, he turned his eyes towards the blue
summits of the mountain, and exclaimed, “What concealest
thou behind thee, pitiless rock? what is passing in thy solitudes?
Whither is she gone? O heaven! perhaps she is now wandering
in thy grottoes with her happy Gulchenrouz!”</p>

<p>In the meantime, the damps began to descend; and the emir,
solicitous for the health of the caliph, ordered the imperial
litter to be brought. Vathek, absorbed in his reveries, was
imperceptibly removed and conveyed back to the saloon that
received him the evening before. But let us leave the caliph
immersed in his new passion, and attend Nouronihar beyond the
rocks, where she had again joined her beloved Gulchenrouz.</p>

<p>This Gulchenrouz was the son of Ali Hassan, brother to the
emir; and the most delicate and lovely creature in the world.
Ali Hassan, who had been absent ten years on a voyage to the
unknown seas, committed, at his departure, this child, the only
survivor of many, to the care and protection of his brother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Gulchenrouz could write in various characters with precision,
and paint upon vellum the most elegant arabesques that fancy
could devise. His sweet voice accompanied the lute in the
most enchanting manner; and when he sang the loves of Megnoun
and Leilah,<a href="#Note_240a" name="Note_91" id="Note_91" class="nanchor">*</a> or some unfortunate lovers of ancient days, tears
insensibly overflowed the cheeks of his auditors. The verses
he composed (for, like Megnoun, he, too, was a poet) inspired
that unresisting languor, so frequently fatal to the female heart.
The women all doted upon him; and, though he had passed his
thirteenth year, they still detained him in the harem.<a href="#Note_240b" name="Note_92" id="Note_92" class="nanchor">*</a> His
dancing was light as the gossamer waved by the zephyrs of
spring; but his arms, which twined so gracefully with those of
the young girls in the dance, could neither dart the lance in the
chase,<a href="#Note_240c" name="Note_93" id="Note_93" class="nanchor">*</a> nor curb the steeds that pastured in his uncle’s domains.
The bow, however, he drew with a certain aim, and would have
excelled his competitors in the race, could he have broken the
ties that bound him to Nouronihar.</p>

<p>The two brothers had mutually engaged their children to
each other; and Nouronihar loved her cousin more than her own
beautiful eyes. Both had the same tastes and amusements;
the same long, languishing looks; the same tresses; the same
fair complexions; and, when Gulchenrouz appeared in the dress
of his cousin, he seemed to be more feminine than even herself.
If, at any time, he left the harem to visit Fakreddin, it was with
all the bashfulness of a fawn, that consciously ventures from
the lair of its dam: he was, however, wanton enough to mock
the solemn old grey-beards, though sure to be rated without
mercy in return. Whenever this happened, he would hastily
plunge into the recesses of the harem; and, sobbing, take refuge
in the fond arms of Nouronihar, who loved even his faults
beyond the virtues of others.</p>

<p>It fell out this evening, that, after leaving the caliph in the
meadow, she ran with Gulchenrouz over the green sward of
the mountain that sheltered the vale where Fakreddin had
chosen to reside. The sun was dilated on the edge of the
horizon; and the young people, whose fancies were lively and
inventive, imagined they beheld, in the gorgeous clouds of the
west, the domes of Shaddukian and Ambreabad,<a href="#Note_240d" name="Note_94" id="Note_94" class="nanchor">*</a> where the
Peries have fixed their abode. Nouronihar, sitting on the slope
of the hill, supported on her knees the perfumed head of
Gulchenrouz. The unexpected arrival of the caliph, and the
splendour that marked his appearance, had already filled with
emotion the ardent soul of Nouronihar. Her vanity irresistibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
prompted her to pique the prince’s attention; and this she
before took good care to effect, whilst he picked up the jasmine
she had thrown upon him. But when Gulchenrouz asked
after the flowers he had culled for her bosom, Nouronihar was
all in confusion. She hastily kissed his forehead, arose in a
flutter, and walked with unequal steps on the border of the
precipice. Night advanced, and the pure gold of the setting
sun had yielded to a sanguine red, the glow of which, like the
reflection of a burning furnace, flushed Nouronihar’s animated
countenance. Gulchenrouz, alarmed at the agitation of his
cousin, said to her, with a supplicating accent, “Let us be gone;
the sky looks portentous, the tamarisks tremble more than
common, and the raw wind chills my very heart. Come! let
us be gone; ’tis a melancholy night!” Then taking hold of her
hand, he drew it towards the path he besought her to go.
Nouronihar unconsciously followed the attraction; for a thousand
strange imaginations occupied her spirits. She passed the large
round of honeysuckles, her favourite resort, without ever vouchsafing
it a glance; yet Gulchenrouz could not help snatching off
a few shoots in his way, though he ran as if a wild beast were
behind.</p>

<p>The young females seeing them approach in such haste,
and, according to custom, expecting a dance, instantly assembled
in a circle and took each other by the hand; but Gulchenrouz,
coming up out of breath, fell down at once on the grass. This
accident struck with consternation the whole of this frolicsome
party; whilst Nouronihar, half distracted and overcome, both
by the violence of her exercise and the tumult of her thoughts,
sunk feebly down at his side, cherished his cold hands in her
bosom, and chafed his temples with a fragrant perfume. At
length he came to himself, and wrapping up his head in the
robe of his cousin, entreated that she would not return to the
harem. He was afraid of being snapped at by Shaban his
tutor, a wrinkled old eunuch of a surly disposition; for, having
interrupted the wonted walk of Nouronihar, he dreaded lest
the churl should take it amiss. The whole of this sprightly
group, sitting round upon a mossy knoll, began to entertain
themselves with various pastimes, whilst their superintendents,
the eunuchs, were gravely conversing at a distance. The nurse
of the emir’s daughter, observing her pupil sit ruminating with
her eyes on the ground, endeavoured to amuse her with diverting
tales; to which Gulchenrouz, who had already forgotten his
inquietudes, listened with a breathless attention. He laughed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
he clapped his hands, and passed a hundred little tricks on the
whole of the company, without omitting the eunuchs, whom he
provoked to run after him, in spite of their age and decrepitude.</p>

<p>During these occurrences, the moon arose, the wind subsided,
and the evening became so serene and inviting, that a resolution
was taken to sup on the spot. One of the eunuchs ran to fetch
melons, whilst others were employed in showering down almonds
from the branches that overhung this amiable party. Sutlememe,
who excelled in dressing a salad, having filled large bowls
of porcelain with eggs of small birds, curds turned with citron
juice, slices of cucumber, and the inmost leaves of delicate
herbs, handed it round from one to another, and gave each their
shares with a large spoon of cocknos.<a href="#Note_242a" name="Note_95" id="Note_95" class="nanchor">*</a> Gulchenrouz, nestling,
as usual, in the bosom of Nouronihar, pouted out his vermilion
little lips against the offer of Sutlememe; and would take it
only from the hand of his cousin, on whose mouth he hung,
like a bee inebriated with the nectar of flowers.</p>

<p>In the midst of this festive scene, there appeared a light on
the top of the highest mountain, which attracted the notice
of every eye. This light was not less bright than the moon
when at full, and might have been taken for her, had not the
moon already risen. The phenomenon occasioned a general
surprise, and no one could conjecture the cause. It could not
be a fire, for the light was clear and bluish; nor had meteors
ever been seen of that magnitude or splendour. This strange
light faded for a moment, and immediately renewed its brightness.
It first appeared motionless, at the foot of the rock;
whence it darted in an instant, to sparkle in a thicket of palm-trees:
from thence it glided along the torrent; and at last fixed
in a glen that was narrow and dark. The moment it had
taken its direction, Gulchenrouz, whose heart always trembled
at anything sudden or rare, drew Nouronihar by the robe, and
anxiously requested her to return to the harem. The women
were importunate in seconding the entreaty; but the curiosity
of the emir’s daughter prevailed. She not only refused to go
back, but resolved, at all hazards, to pursue the appearance.</p>

<p>Whilst they were debating what was best to be done, the
light shot forth so dazzling a blaze that they all fled away
shrieking. Nouronihar followed them a few steps; but, coming
to the turn of a little by-path, stopped, and went back alone.
As she ran with an alertness peculiar to herself, it was not long
before she came to the place where they had just been supping.
The globe of fire now appeared stationary in the glen, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
burned in majestic stillness. Nouronihar, pressing her hands
upon her bosom, hesitated, for some moments, to advance.
The solitude of her situation was new, the silence of the night
awful, and every object inspired sensations which, till then,
she never had felt. The affright of Gulchenrouz recurred to
her mind, and she a thousand times turned to go back; but this
luminous appearance was always before her. Urged on by an
irresistible impulse, she continued to approach it, in defiance of
every obstacle that opposed her progress.</p>

<p>At length she arrived at the opening of the glen; but, instead
of coming up to the light, she found herself surrounded by
darkness; excepting that, at a considerable distance, a faint
spark glimmered by fits. She stopped a second time: the
sound of waterfalls mingling their murmurs, the hollow rustlings
among the palm-branches, and the funereal screams of the birds
from their rifted trunks, all conspired to fill her soul with terror.
She imagined, every moment, that she trod on some venomous
reptile. All the stories of malignant dives and dismal ghouls<a href="#Note_243a" name="Note_96" id="Note_96" class="nanchor">*</a>
thronged into her memory; but her curiosity was, notwithstanding,
more predominant than her fears. She therefore firmly
entered a winding track that led towards the spark; but, being
a stranger to the path, she had not gone far, till she began to
repent of her rashness. “Alas!” said she, “that I were but
in those secure and illuminated apartments, where my evenings
glided on with Gulchenrouz! Dear child! how would thy
heart flutter with terror, wert thou wandering in these wild
solitudes, like me!” Thus speaking, she advanced, and coming
up to steps hewn in the rock, ascended them undismayed. The
light, which was now gradually enlarging, appeared above
her on the summit of the mountain, and as if proceeding from a
cavern. At length, she distinguished a plaintive and melodious
union of voices, that resembled the dirges which are sung over
tombs. A sound like that which arises from the filling of baths
struck her ear at the same time. She continued ascending,
and discovered large wax torches in full blaze, planted here
and there in the fissures of the rock. This appearance filled
her with fear, whilst the subtle and potent odour which the
torches exhaled caused her to sink, almost lifeless, at the
entrance of the grot.</p>

<p>Casting her eyes within in this kind of trance, she beheld
a large cistern of gold, filled with a water, the vapour of which
distilled on her face a dew of the essence of roses. A soft
symphony resounded through the grot. On the sides of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
cistern she noticed appendages of royalty, diadems and feathers
of the heron, all sparkling with carbuncles.<a href="#Note_244a" name="Note_97" id="Note_97" class="nanchor">*</a> Whilst her attention
was fixed on this display of magnificence, the music ceased,
and a voice instantly demanded, “For what monarch are
these torches kindled, this bath prepared, and these habiliments
which belong not only to the sovereigns of the earth, but even
to the talismanic powers?” To which a second voice answered,
“They are for the charming daughter of the Emir Fakreddin.”&mdash;“What,”
replied the first, “for that trifler, who consumes her
time with a giddy child, immersed in softness, and who, at best,
can make but a pitiful husband?”&mdash;“And can she,” rejoined
the other voice, “be amused with such empty toys, whilst the
caliph, the sovereign of the world, he who is destined to enjoy
the treasures of the pre-Adamite sultans, a prince six feet high,
and whose eyes pervade the inmost soul of a female,<a href="#Note_244b" name="Note_98" id="Note_98" class="nanchor">*</a> is inflamed
with love for her? No! she will be wise enough to answer
that passion alone that can aggrandize her glory. No doubt
she will, and despise the puppet of her fancy. Then all the
riches this place contains, as well as the carbuncle of Giamschid,<a href="#Note_244c" name="Note_99" id="Note_99" class="nanchor">*</a>
shall be hers.”&mdash;“You judge right,” returned the first voice;
“and I haste to Istakar to prepare the palace of subterranean
fire for the reception of the bridal pair.”</p>

<p>The voices ceased; the torches were extinguished; the most
entire darkness succeeded; and Nouronihar, recovering with a
start, found herself reclined on a sofa in the harem of her father.
She clapped her hands, and immediately came together Gulchenrouz
and her women, who, in despair at having lost her,
had dispatched eunuchs to seek her in every direction. Shaban
appeared with the rest, and began to reprimand her, with an
air of consequence: “Little impertinent,” said he, “have you
false keys, or are you beloved of some genius that hath given
you a picklock? I will try the extent of your power: come
to the dark chamber,<a href="#Note_244d" name="Note_100" id="Note_100" class="nanchor">*</a> and expect not the company of Gulchenrouz:
be expeditious! I will shut you up, and turn the key
twice upon you!” At these menaces, Nouronihar indignantly
raised her head, opened on Shaban her black eyes, which, since
the important dialogue of the enchanted grot, were considerably
enlarged, and said, “Go, speak thus to slaves; but learn
to reverence her who is born to give laws, and subject all to
her power.”</p>

<p>Proceeding in the same style, she was interrupted by a
sudden exclamation of “The caliph! the caliph!” All the
curtains were thrown open, the slaves prostrated themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in double rows, and poor little Gulchenrouz went to hide
beneath the couch of a sofa. At first appeared a file of black
eunuchs trailing after them long trains of muslin embroidered
with gold, and holding in their hands censers, which dispensed,
as they passed, the grateful perfume of the wood of aloes.
Next marched Bababalouk with a solemn strut, and tossing
his head, as not overpleased at the visit. Vathek came close
after, superbly robed: his gait was unembarrassed and noble;
and his presence would have engaged admiration, though he
had not been the sovereign of the world. He approached
Nouronihar with a throbbing heart, and seemed enraptured at
the full effulgence of her radiant eyes, of which he had before
caught but a few glimpses; but she instantly depressed them,
and her confusion augmented her beauty.</p>

<p>Bababalouk, who was a thorough adept in coincidences of
this nature, and knew that the worst game should be played
with the best face, immediately made a signal for all to retire;
and no sooner did he perceive beneath the sofa the little one’s
feet, than he drew him forth without ceremony, set him upon
his shoulders, and lavished him, as he went off, a thousand
unwelcome caresses. Gulchenrouz cried out, and resisted till
his cheeks became the colour of the blossom of pomegranates,
and his tearful eyes sparkled with indignation. He cast a
significant glance at Nouronihar, which the caliph noticing,
asked, “Is that, then, your Gulchenrouz?”&mdash;“Sovereign of
the world!” answered she, “spare my cousin, whose innocence
and gentleness deserve not your anger!”&mdash;“Take
comfort,” said Vathek, with a smile: “he is in good hands.
Bababalouk is fond of children, and never goes without sweetmeats
and comfits.” The daughter of Fakreddin was abashed,
and suffered Gulchenrouz to be borne away without adding a
word. The tumult of her bosom betrayed her confusion, and
Vathek, becoming still more impassioned, gave a loose to his
frenzy; which had only not subdued the last faint strugglings of
reluctance, when the emir, suddenly bursting in, threw his face
upon the ground at the feet of the caliph, and said, “Commander
of the faithful! abase not yourself to the meanness of
your slave.”&mdash;“No, emir,” replied Vathek, “I raise her to
an equality with myself: I declare her my wife; and the glory
of your race shall extend from one generation to another.”&mdash;“Alas!
my lord,” said Fakreddin, as he plucked off a few grey
hairs of his beard, “cut short the days of your faithful servant,
rather than force him to depart from his word. Nouronihar is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
solemnly promised to Gulchenrouz, the son of my brother
Ali Hassan: they are united, also, in heart; their faith is mutually
plighted;<a href="#Note_246a" name="Note_101" id="Note_101" class="nanchor">*</a> and affiances, so sacred, cannot be broken.”&mdash;“What
then!” replied the caliph bluntly; “would you surrender this
divine beauty to a husband more womanish than herself? and
can you imagine that I will suffer her charms to decay in hands
so inefficient and nerveless? No! she is destined to live out
her life within my embraces: such is my will; retire, and disturb
not the night I devote to the worship of her charms.”</p>

<p>The irritated emir drew forth his sabre, presented it to
Vathek, and stretching out his neck, said, in a firm tone of
voice, “Strike your unhappy host, my lord: he has lived long
enough, since he hath seen the Prophet’s vicegerent violate the
rights of hospitality.”<a href="#Note_246b" name="Note_102" id="Note_102" class="nanchor">*</a> At his uttering these words, Nouronihar,
unable to support any longer the conflict of her passions, sunk
down into a swoon. Vathek, both terrified for her life and
furious at an opposition to his will, bade Fakreddin assist his
daughter, and withdrew; darting his terrible look at the unfortunate
emir, who suddenly fell backward, bathed in a sweat
as cold as the damp of death.</p>

<p>Gulchenrouz, who had escaped from the hands of Bababalouk,
and was at that instant returned, called out for help as loudly
as he could, not having strength to afford it himself. Pale and
panting, the poor child attempted to revive Nouronihar by
caresses; and it happened, that the thrilling warmth of his lips
restored her to life. Fakreddin, beginning also to recover from
the look of the caliph, with difficulty tottered to a seat; and,
after warily casting round his eye, to see if this dangerous
prince were gone, sent for Shaban and Sutlememe; and said to
them apart, “My friends! violent evils require violent remedies;
the caliph has brought desolation and horror into my family;
and how shall we resist his power? Another of his looks will
send me to the grave. Fetch, then, that narcotic powder<a href="#Note_246c" name="Note_103" id="Note_103" class="nanchor">*</a>
which a dervish brought me from Aracan. A dose of it, the
effect of which will continue three days, must be administered
to each of these children. The caliph will believe them to be
dead; for they will have all the appearance of death. We shall
go as if to inter them in the cave of Meimouné, at the entrance
of the great desert of sand, and near the bower of my dwarfs.
When all the spectators shall be withdrawn, you, Shaban, and
four select eunuchs, shall convey them to the lake; where
provision shall be ready to support them a month: for one day
allotted to the surprise this event will occasion, five to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
tears, a fortnight to reflection, and the rest to prepare for
renewing his progress, will, according to my calculation, fill
up the whole time that Vathek will tarry; and I shall then be
freed from his intrusion.”</p>

<p>“Your plan is good,” said Sutlememe, “if it can but be
effected. I have remarked, that Nouronihar is well able to
support the glances of the caliph, and that he is far from being
sparing of them to her; be assured, therefore, that, notwithstanding
her fondness for Gulchenrouz, she will never remain
quiet, while she knows him to be here. Let us persuade her
that both herself and Gulchenrouz are really dead, and that
they were conveyed to those rocks, for a limited season, to
expiate the little faults of which their love was the cause. We
will add, that we killed ourselves in despair; and that your
dwarfs, whom they never yet saw, will preach to them delectable
sermons. I will engage that everything shall succeed to the
bent of your wishes.”&mdash;“Be it so!” said Fakreddin: “I approve
your proposal: let us lose not a moment to give it effect.”</p>

<p>They hastened to seek for the powder, which, being mixed in
a sherbet was immediately administered to Gulchenrouz and
Nouronihar. Within the space of an hour, both were seized with
violent palpitations, and a general numbness gradually ensued.
They arose from the floor where they had remained ever since
the caliph’s departure, and, ascending to the sofa, reclined
themselves upon it, clasped in each other’s embraces. “Cherish
me, my dear Nouronihar!” said Gulchenrouz: “put thy hand
upon my heart; it feels as if it were frozen. Alas! thou art as
cold as myself! hath the caliph murdered us both, with his
terrible look?”&mdash;“I am dying!” cried she, in a faltering voice:
“press me closer; I am ready to expire!”&mdash;“Let us die, then,
together,” answered the little Gulchenrouz, whilst his breast
laboured with a convulsive sigh; “let me, at least, breathe
forth my soul on thy lips!” They spoke no more, and became
as dead.</p>

<p>Immediately the most piercing cries were heard through the
harem; whilst Shaban and Sutlememe personated, with great
adroitness, the parts of persons in despair. The emir, who
was sufficiently mortified to be forced into such untoward
expedients, and had now, for the first time, made a trial of his
powder, was under no necessity of counterfeiting grief. The
slaves, who had flocked together from all quarters, stood motionless
at the spectacle before them. All lights were extinguished,
save two lamps, which shed a wan glimmering over the faces of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
these lovely flowers, that seemed to be faded in the spring-time
of life. Funeral vestments were prepared; their bodies were
washed<a href="#Note_248a" name="Note_104" id="Note_104" class="nanchor">*</a> with rose-water; their beautiful tresses were braided
and incensed; and they were wrapped in cymars whiter than
alabaster.</p>

<p>At the moment that their attendants were placing two wreaths
of their favourite jasmines on their brows, the caliph, who had
just heard the tragical catastrophe, arrived. He looked not less
pale and haggard than the ghouls that wander at night among
the graves. Forgetful of himself and every one else, he broke
through the midst of the slaves; fell prostrate at the foot of the
sofa; beat his bosom; called himself “atrocious murderer!”
and invoked upon his head a thousand imprecations. With a
trembling hand he raised the veil that covered the countenance
of Nouronihar, and uttering a loud shriek, fell lifeless on the
floor. The chief of the eunuchs dragged him off, with horrible
grimaces, and repeated as he went, “Ay, I foresaw she would
play you some ungracious turn!”</p>

<p>No sooner was the caliph gone, than the emir commanded
biers to be brought, and forbade that any one should enter the
harem. Every window was fastened; all instruments of music
were broken;<a href="#Note_248b" name="Note_105" id="Note_105" class="nanchor">*</a>
and the imans began to recite their prayers.<a href="#Note_248c" name="Note_106" id="Note_106" class="nanchor">*</a>
Towards the close of this melancholy day, Vathek sobbed in
silence; for they had been forced to compose with anodynes
his convulsions of rage and desperation.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the succeeding morning, the wide folding
doors of the palace were set open, and the funeral procession
moved forward for the mountain. The wailful cries of “La
Ilah illa Alla!”<a href="#Note_248d" name="Note_107" id="Note_107" class="nanchor">*</a> reached the caliph, who was eager to cicatrize
himself and attend the ceremonial; nor could he have been
dissuaded, had not his excessive weakness disabled him from
walking. At the few first steps he fell on the ground, and
his people were obliged to lay him on a bed, where he remained
many days in such a state of insensibility as excited compassion
in the emir himself.</p>

<p>When the procession was arrived at the grot of Meimouné,
Shaban and Sutlememe dismissed the whole of the train,
excepting the four confidential eunuchs who were appointed
to remain. After resting some moments near the biers, which
had been left in the open air, they caused them to be carried to
the brink of a small lake, whose banks were overgrown with
a hoary moss. This was the great resort of herons and storks,
which preyed continually on little blue fishes. The dwarfs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
instructed by the emir, soon repaired thither, and, with the
help of the eunuchs, began to construct cabins of rushes and
reeds, a work in which they had admirable skill. A magazine
also was contrived for provisions, with a small oratory for themselves,
and a pyramid of wood, neatly piled, to furnish the
necessary fuel, for the air was bleak in the hollows of the
mountains.</p>

<p>At evening two fires were kindled on the brink of the lake,
and the two lovely bodies, taken from their biers, were carefully
deposited upon a bed of dried leaves within the same
cabin. The dwarfs began to recite the Koran, with their clear
shrill voices; and Shaban and Sutlememe stood at some distance,
anxiously waiting the effects of the powder. At length Nouronihar
and Gulchenrouz faintly stretched out their arms; and,
gradually opening their eyes, began to survey, with looks of
increasing amazement, every object around them. They even
attempted to rise; but, for want of strength, fell back again.
Sutlememe, on this, administered a cordial, which the emir had
taken care to provide.</p>

<p>Gulchenrouz, thoroughly aroused, sneezed out aloud; and,
raising himself with an effort that expressed his surprise, left
the cabin and inhaled the fresh air with the greatest avidity.
“Yes,” said he, “I breathe again! again do I exist! I hear sounds!
I behold a firmament, spangled over with stars!” Nouronihar,
catching these beloved accents, extricated herself from the
leaves and ran to clasp Gulchenrouz to her bosom. The first
objects she remarked were their long cymars, their garlands of
flowers, and their naked feet: she hid her face in her hands to
reflect. The vision of the enchanted bath, the despair of her
father, and, more vividly than both, the majestic figure of
Vathek, recurred to her memory. She recollected, also, that
herself and Gulchenrouz had been sick and dying; but all these
images bewildered her mind. Not knowing where she was, she
turned her eyes on all sides, as if to recognize the surrounding
scene. This singular lake, those flames reflected from its glassy
surface, the pale hues of its banks, the romantic cabins, the
bulrushes that sadly waved their drooping heads, the storks
whose melancholy cries blended with the shrill voices of the
dwarfs&mdash;everything conspired to persuade her that the angel
of death had opened the portal of some other world.<a href="#Note_249a" name="Note_108" id="Note_108" class="nanchor">*</a></p>

<p>Gulchenrouz on his part, lost in wonder, clung to the neck
of his cousin. He believed himself in the region of phantoms,
and was terrified at the silence she preserved. At length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
addressing her: “Speak,” said he; “where are we? Do you
not see those spectres that are stirring the burning coals? Are
they Monker and Nekir<a href="#Note_250a" name="Note_109" id="Note_109" class="nanchor">*</a> who are come to throw us into them?
Does the fatal bridge<a href="#Note_250b" name="Note_110" id="Note_110" class="nanchor">*</a> cross this lake, whose solemn stillness
perhaps conceals from us an abyss, in which for whole ages
we shall be doomed incessantly to sink?”</p>

<p>“No, my children,” said Sutlememe, going towards them;
“take comfort! the exterminating angel, who conducted our
souls hither after yours, hath assured us, that the chastisement
of your indolent and voluptuous life shall be restricted to a
certain series of years,<a href="#Note_250c" name="Note_111" id="Note_111" class="nanchor">*</a> which you must pass in this dreary
abode; where the sun is scarcely visible, and where the soil
yields neither fruits nor flowers. These,” continued she,
pointing to the dwarfs, “will provide for our wants; for souls
so mundane as ours retain too strong a tincture of their earthly
extraction. Instead of meats, your food will be nothing but
rice; and your bread shall be moistened in the fogs that brood
over the surface of the lake.”</p>

<p>At this desolating prospect, the poor children burst into tears,
and prostrated themselves before the dwarfs; who perfectly
supported their characters, and delivered an excellent discourse,
of a customary length, upon the sacred camel<a href="#Note_250d" name="Note_112" id="Note_112" class="nanchor">*</a> which, after a
thousand years, was to convey them to the paradise of the
faithful.</p>

<p>The sermon being ended, and ablutions performed, they
praised Alla and the Prophet, supped very indifferently, and
retired to their withered leaves. Nouronihar and her little
cousin consoled themselves on finding that the dead might lie
in one cabin. Having slept well before, the remainder of the
night was spent in conversation on what had befallen them;
and both, from a dread of apparitions, betook themselves for
protection to one another’s arms.</p>

<p>In the morning, which was lowering and rainy, the dwarfs
mounted high poles, like minarets, and called them to prayers.
The whole congregation, which consisted of Sutlememe, Shaban,
the four eunuchs, and a few storks that were tired of fishing,
was already assembled. The two children came forth from
their cabin with a slow and dejected pace. As their minds
were in a tender and melancholy mood, their devotions were
performed with fervour. No sooner were they finished than
Gulchenrouz demanded of Sutlememe and the rest, “how they
happened to die so opportunely for his cousin and himself?”&mdash;“We
killed ourselves,” returned Sutlememe, “in despair at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
your death.” On this, Nouronihar, who, notwithstanding what
had passed, had not yet forgotten her vision, said, “And the
caliph! is he also dead of his grief? and will he likewise come
hither?” The dwarfs, who were prepared with an answer,
most demurely replied, “Vathek is damned beyond all redemption!”&mdash;“I
readily believe so,” said Gulchenrouz; “and am
glad, from my heart, to hear it; for I am convinced it was his
horrible look that sent us hither, to listen to sermons, and
mess upon rice.” One week passed away on the side of the
lake unmarked by any variety; Nouronihar ruminating on the
grandeur of which death had deprived her, and Gulchenrouz
applying to prayers and basket-making<a href="#Note_251a" name="Note_113" id="Note_113" class="nanchor">*</a> with the dwarfs, who
infinitely pleased him.</p>

<p>Whilst this scene of innocence was exhibiting in the mountains,
the caliph presented himself to the emir in a new light.<a href="#Note_251b" name="Note_114" id="Note_114" class="nanchor">*</a>
The instant he recovered the use of his senses, with a voice that
made Bababalouk quake, he thundered out, “Perfidious
Giaour! I renounce thee for ever! it is thou who hast slain my
beloved Nouronihar! and I supplicate the pardon of Mahomet,
who would have preserved her to me had I been more wise.
Let water be brought to perform my ablutions, and let the
pious Fakreddin be called to offer up his prayers with mine,
and reconcile me to him. Afterwards, we will go together and
visit the sepulchre of the unfortunate Nouronihar. I am
resolved to become a hermit, and consume the residue of my
days on this mountain, in hope of expiating my crimes.”&mdash;“And
what do you intend to live upon there?” inquired
Bababalouk.&mdash;“I hardly know,” replied Vathek; “but I will
tell you when I feel hungry&mdash;which, I believe, will not soon
be the case.”</p>

<p>The arrival of Fakreddin put a stop to this conversation.
As soon as Vathek saw him, he threw his arms around his neck,
bedewed his face with a torrent of tears, and uttered things
so affecting, so pious, that the emir, crying for joy, congratulated
himself in his heart upon having performed so admirable and
unexpected a conversion. As for the pilgrimage to the mountain,
Fakreddin had his reasons not to oppose it; therefore,
each ascending his own litter, they started.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the vigilance with which his attendants
watched the caliph, they could not prevent his harrowing his
cheeks with a few scratches, when on the place where he was
told Nouronihar had been buried; they were even obliged to
drag him away, by force of hands, from the melancholy spot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
However, he swore, with a solemn oath, that he would return
thither every day. This resolution did not exactly please the
emir&mdash;yet he flattered himself that the caliph might not proceed
farther, and would merely perform his devotions in the
cavern of Meimouné. Besides, the lake was so completely
concealed within the solitary bosom of those tremendous
rocks, that he thought it utterly impossible any one could ever
find it. This security of Fakreddin was also considerably
strengthened by the conduct of Vathek, who performed his
vow most scrupulously, and returned daily from the hill so
devout, and so contrite, that all the grey-beards were in a state
of ecstasy on account of it.</p>

<p>Nouronihar was not altogether so content; for though she
felt a fondness for Gulchenrouz, who, to augment the attachment,
had been left at full liberty with her, yet she still regarded
him as but a bauble that bore no competition with the carbuncle
of Giamschid. At times, she indulged doubts on the mode
of her being; and scarcely could believe that the dead had all
the wants and the whims of the living. To gain satisfaction,
however, on so perplexing a topic, one morning, whilst all were
asleep, she arose with a breathless caution from the side of
Gulchenrouz; and, after having given him a soft kiss, began to
follow the windings of the lake, till it terminated with a rock,
the top of which was accessible, though lofty. This she climbed
with considerable toil; and having reached the summit, set
forward in a run, like a doe before the hunter. Though she
skipped with the alertness of an antelope, yet, at intervals,
she was forced to desist, and rest beneath the tamarisks to
recover her breath. Whilst she, thus reclined, was occupied
with her little reflections on the apprehension that she had
some knowledge of the place, Vathek, who, finding himself
that morning but ill at ease, had gone forth before the dawn,
presented himself on a sudden to her view. Motionless with
surprise, he durst not approach the figure before him trembling
and pale, but yet lovely to behold. At length Nouronihar,
with a mixture of pleasure and affliction, raising her fine eyes
to him, said, “My lord! are you then come hither to eat rice
and hear sermons with me?”&mdash;“Beloved phantom!” cried
Vathek, “thou dost speak; thou hast the same graceful form;
the same radiant features; art thou palpable likewise?” and,
eagerly embracing her, added, “Here are limbs and a bosom
animated with a gentle warmth!&mdash;What can such a prodigy
mean?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Nouronihar, with indifference, answered,&mdash;“You know, my
lord, that I died on the very night you honoured me with
your visit. My cousin maintains it was from one of your
glances; but I cannot believe him; for to me they seem not so
dreadful. Gulchenrouz died with me, and we were both brought
into a region of desolation, where we are fed with a wretched
diet. If you be dead also, and are come hither to join us, I
pity your lot; for you will be stunned with the clang of the
dwarfs and the storks. Besides, it is mortifying in the extreme,
that you, as well as myself, should have lost the treasures of
the subterranean palace.”</p>

<p>At the mention of the subterranean palace, the caliph suspended
his caresses (which, indeed, had proceeded pretty far),
to seek from Nouronihar an explanation of her meaning. She
then recapitulated her vision, what immediately followed,
and the history of her pretended death; adding, also, a description
of the place of expiation from whence she had fled; and
all in a manner that would have extorted his laughter, had not
the thoughts of Vathek been too deeply engaged. No sooner,
however, had she ended, than he again clasped her to his bosom
and said, “Light of my eyes, the mystery is unravelled; we
both are alive! Your father is a cheat, who, for the sake of
dividing us, hath deluded us both; and the Giaour, whose
design, as far as I can discover, is that we shall proceed together,
seems scarce a whit better. It shall be some time at least
before he finds us in his palace of fire. Your lovely little person
in my estimation is far more precious than all the treasures
of the pre-Adamite sultans; and I wish to possess it at pleasure,
and in open day, for many a moon, before I go to burrow underground,
like a mole. Forget this little trifler, Gulchenrouz;
and&mdash;&mdash;”&mdash;“Ah, my lord!” interposed Nouronihar, “let me
entreat that you do him no evil.”&mdash;“No, no!” replied Vathek;
“I have already bid you forbear to alarm yourself for him.
He has been brought up too much on milk and sugar to stimulate
my jealousy. We will leave him with the dwarfs; who, by
the by, are my old acquaintances: their company will suit
him far better than yours. As to other matters, I will return
no more to your father’s. I want not to have my ears dinned
by him and his dotards with the violation of the rights of
hospitality, as if it were less an honour for you to espouse the
sovereign of the world than a girl dressed up like a boy.”</p>

<p>Nouronihar could find nothing to oppose in a discourse
so eloquent. She only wished the amorous monarch had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
discovered more ardour for the carbuncle of Giamschid; but
flattered herself it would gradually increase, and therefore
yielded to his will with the most bewitching submission.</p>

<p>When the caliph judged it proper, he called for Bababalouk,
who was asleep in the cave of Meimouné, and dreaming that
the phantom of Nouronihar, having mounted him once more
on her swing, had just given him such a jerk, that he one
moment soared above the mountains, and the next sunk into
the abyss. Starting from his sleep at the sound of his master,
he ran, gasping for breath, and had nearly fallen backward at
the sight, as he believed, of the spectre by whom he had so
lately been haunted in his dream. “Ah, my lord!” cried he,
recoiling ten steps, and covering his eyes with both hands,
“do you then perform the office of a ghoul? have you dug up the
dead? Yet hope not to make her your prey; for, after all she
hath caused me to suffer, she is wicked enough to prey even
upon you.”</p>

<p>“Cease to play the fool,” said Vathek, “and thou shalt soon
be convinced that it is Nouronihar herself, alive and well, whom
I clasp to my breast. Go and pitch my tents in the neighbouring
valley. There will I fix my abode, with this beautiful
tulip, whose colours I soon shall restore. There exert thy best
endeavours to procure whatever can augment the enjoyments
of life, till I shall disclose to thee more of my will.”</p>

<p>The news of so unlucky an event soon reached the ears of
the emir, who abandoned himself to grief and despair, and
began, as did his old grey-beards, to begrime his visage with
ashes. A total supineness ensued; travellers were no longer
entertained; no more plasters were spread; and, instead of the
charitable activity that had distinguished this asylum, the
whole of its inhabitants exhibited only faces of half a cubit
long, and uttered groans that accorded with their forlorn
situation.</p>

<p>Though Fakreddin bewailed his daughter as lost to him for
ever, yet Gulchenrouz was not forgotten. He dispatched
immediate instructions to Sutlememe, Shaban, and the dwarfs,
enjoining them not to undeceive the child in respect to his
state, but, under some pretence, to convey him far from the
lofty rock at the extremity of the lake, to a place which he
should appoint, as safer from danger, for he suspected that
Vathek intended him evil.</p>

<p>Gulchenrouz, in the meanwhile, was filled with amazement
at not finding his cousin; nor were the dwarfs less surprised:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
but Sutlememe, who had more penetration, immediately guessed
what had happened. Gulchenrouz was amused with the delusive
hope of once more embracing Nouronihar in the interior recesses
of the mountains, where the ground, strewed over with orange
blossoms and jasmines, offered beds much more inviting than
the withered leaves in their cabin; where they might accompany
with their voices the sounds of their lutes, and chase butterflies.
Sutlememe was far gone in this sort of description, when one of
the four eunuchs beckoned her aside, to apprise her of the
arrival of a messenger from their fraternity, who had explained
the secret of the flight of Nouronihar, and brought the commands
of the emir. A council with Shaban and the dwarfs was immediately
held. Their baggage being stowed in consequence of it,
they embarked in a shallop, and quietly sailed with the little
one, who acquiesced in all their proposals. Their voyage
proceeded in the same manner, till they came to the place where
the lake sinks beneath the hollow of a rock: but as soon as the
bark had entered it, and Gulchenrouz found himself surrounded
with darkness, he was seized with a dreadful consternation, and
incessantly uttered the most piercing outcries; for he now was
persuaded he should actually be damned for having taken too
many little freedoms in his lifetime with his cousin.</p>

<p>But let us return to the caliph, and her who ruled over his
heart. Bababalouk had pitched the tents, and closed up the
extremities of the valley with magnificent screens of India
cloth, which were guarded by Ethiopian slaves with their drawn
sabres. To preserve the verdure of this beautiful enclosure in
its natural freshness, white eunuchs went continually round it
with gilt water vessels. The waving of fans<a href="#Note_255a" name="Note_115" id="Note_115" class="nanchor">*</a> was heard near
the imperial pavilion; where, by the voluptuous light that
glowed through the muslins, the caliph enjoyed, at full view,
all the attractions of Nouronihar. Inebriated with delight,
he was all ear to her charming voice, which accompanied the
lute; while she was not less captivated with his descriptions of
Samarah, and the tower full of wonders, but especially with
his relation of the adventure of the ball, and the chasm of the
Giaour, with its ebony portal.</p>

<p>In this manner they conversed the whole day, and at night
they bathed together in a basin of black marble, which admirably
set off the fairness of Nouronihar. Bababalouk, whose
good graces this beauty had regained, spared no attention,
that their repasts might be served up with the minutest exactness:
some exquisite rarity was ever placed before them; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
sent even to Schiraz, for that fragrant and delicious wine which
had been hoarded up in bottles, prior to the birth of Mahomet.<a href="#Note_256a" name="Note_116" id="Note_116" class="nanchor">*</a>
He had excavated little ovens in the rock,<a href="#Note_256b" name="Note_117" id="Note_117" class="nanchor">*</a> to bake the nice
manchets which were prepared by the hands of Nouronihar,
from whence they had derived a flavour so grateful to Vathek,
that he regarded the ragouts of his other wives as entirely
mawkish: whilst they would have died of chagrin at the emir’s,
at finding themselves so neglected, if Fakreddin, notwithstanding
his resentment, had not taken pity upon them.</p>

<p>The Sultana Dilara, who, till then, had been the favourite,
took this dereliction of the caliph to heart, with a vehemence
natural to her character; for, during her continuance in favour,
she had imbibed from Vathek many of his extravagant fancies,
and was fired with impatience to behold the superb tombs of
Istakar, and the palace of forty columns; besides, having been
brought up amongst the magi, she had fondly cherished the
idea of the caliph’s devoting himself to the worship of fire: thus
his voluptuous and desultory life with her rival was to her a
double source of affliction. The transient piety of Vathek had
occasioned her some serious alarms; but the present was an
evil of far greater magnitude. She resolved, therefore, without
hesitation, to write to Carathis, and acquaint her that all things
went ill; that they had eaten, slept, and revelled at an old
emir’s, whose sanctity was very formidable; and that, after
all, the prospect of possessing the treasures of the pre-Adamite
sultans was no less remote than before. This letter was entrusted
to the care of two woodmen, who were at work in one of the
great forests of the mountains, and who, being acquainted with
the shortest cuts, arrived in ten days at Samarah.</p>

<p>The Princess Carathis was engaged at chess with Morakanabad,
when the arrival of these woodfellers was announced. She, after
some weeks of Vathek’s absence, had forsaken the upper regions
of her tower, because everything appeared in confusion among
the stars, which she consulted relative to the fate of her son.
In vain did she renew her fumigations, and extend herself on
the roof, to obtain mystic visions; nothing more could she see
in her dreams, than pieces of brocade, nosegays of flowers, and
other unmeaning gewgaws. These disappointments had thrown
her into a state of dejection, which no drug in her power was
sufficient to remove. Her only resource was in Morakanabad,
who was a good man, and endowed with a decent share of
confidence; yet whilst in her company he never thought himself
on roses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
No person knew aught of Vathek, and, of course, a thousand
ridiculous stories were propagated at his expense. The eagerness
of Carathis may be easily guessed at receiving the letter,
as well as her rage at reading the dissolute conduct of her son.
“Is it so?” said she; “either I will perish, or Vathek shall enter
the palace of fire. Let me expire in flames, provided he may
reign on the throne of Soliman!” Having said this, and
whirled herself round in a magical manner, which struck
Morakanabad with such terror as caused him to recoil, she
ordered her great camel Alboufaki<a href="#Note_257a" name="Note_118" id="Note_118" class="nanchor">*</a> to be brought, and the
hideous Nerkes, with the unrelenting Cafour, to attend. “I
require no other retinue,” said she to Morakanabad; “I am
going on affairs of emergency; a truce, therefore, to parade!
Take you care of the people: fleece them well in my absence;
for we shall expend large sums, and one knows not what may
betide.”</p>

<p>The night was uncommonly dark, and a pestilential blast
blew from the plain of Catoul, that would have deterred any
other traveller, however urgent the call: but Carathis enjoyed
most whatever filled others with dread. Nerkes concurred in
opinion with her; and Cafour had a particular predilection for
a pestilence. In the morning this accomplished caravan, with
the woodfellers, who directed their route, halted on the edge
of an extensive marsh, from whence so noxious a vapour arose
as would have destroyed any animal but Alboufaki, who
naturally inhaled these malignant fogs with delight. The
peasants entreated their convoy not to sleep in this place.
“To sleep,” cried Carathis, “what an excellent thought! I
never sleep, but for visions; and, as to my attendants, their
occupations are too many to close the only eye they have.”
The poor peasants, who were not overpleased with their party,
remained open-mouthed with surprise.</p>

<p>Carathis alighted, as well as her negresses; and, severally
stripping off their outer garments, they all ran to cull from
those spots where the sun shone fiercest the venomous plants
that grew on the marsh. This provision was made for the
family of the emir, and whoever might retard the expedition
to Istakar. The woodmen were overcome with fear, when
they beheld these three horrible phantoms run; and, not much
relishing the company of Alboufaki, stood aghast at the command
of Carathis to set forward, notwithstanding it was noon,<a href="#Note_257b" name="Note_119" id="Note_119" class="nanchor">*</a> and the
heat fierce enough to calcine even rocks. In spite, however, of
every remonstrance, they were forced implicitly to submit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Alboufaki, who delighted in solitude, constantly snorted whenever
he perceived himself near a habitation; and Carathis, who
was apt to spoil him with indulgence, as constantly turned him
aside: so that the peasants were precluded from procuring subsistence;
for the milch goats and ewes, which Providence had
sent towards the district they traversed to refresh travellers
with their milk, all fled at the sight of the hideous animal and
his strange riders. As to Carathis, she needed no common
aliment; for her invention had previously furnished her with
an opiate to stay her stomach, some of which she imparted
to her mutes.</p>

<p>At dusk Alboufaki, making a sudden stop, stamped with his
foot; which, to Carathis, who knew his ways, was a certain
indication that she was near the confines of some cemetery.<a href="#Note_258a" name="Note_120" id="Note_120" class="nanchor">*</a>
The moon shed a bright light on the spot, which served to
discover a long wall with a large door in it, standing ajar, and
so high that Alboufaki might easily enter. The miserable
guides, who perceived their end approaching, humbly implored
Carathis, as she had now so good an opportunity, to inter them,
and immediately gave up the ghost. Nerkes and Cafour, whose
wit was of a style peculiar to themselves, were by no means
parsimonious of it on the folly of these poor people; nor could
anything have been found more suited to their taste than the
site of the burying-ground, and the sepulchres which its precincts
contained. There were at least two thousand of them on
the declivity of a hill. Carathis was too eager to execute her
plan to stop at the view, charming as it appeared in her eyes.
Pondering the advantages that might accrue from her present
situation, she said to herself, “So beautiful a cemetery must be
haunted by ghouls! they never want for intelligence: having
heedlessly suffered my stupid guides to expire, I will apply
for directions to them; and, as an inducement, will invite them
to regale on these fresh corpses.” After this wise soliloquy,
she beckoned to Nerkes and Cafour, and made signs with her
fingers, as much as to say, “Go; knock against the sides of the
tombs, and strike up your delightful warblings.”</p>

<p>The negresses, full of joy at the behests of their mistress,
and promising themselves much pleasure from the society of
the ghouls, went with an air of conquest, and began their
knockings at the tombs. As their strokes were repeated, a
hollow noise was made in the earth; the surface hove up into
heaps; and the ghouls, on all sides, protruded their noses to
inhale the effluvia which the carcasses of the woodmen began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to emit. They assembled before a sarcophagus of white marble,
where Carathis was seated between the bodies of her miserable
guides. The princess received her visitants with distinguished
politeness; and, supper being ended, they talked of business.
Carathis soon learned from them everything she wanted to
discover; and, without loss of time, prepared to set forward
on her journey. Her negresses, who were forming tender connections
with the ghouls, importuned her, with all their fingers,
to wait at least till the dawn. But Carathis, being chastity in
the abstract, and an implacable enemy to love intrigues and
sloth, at once rejected their prayer, mounted Alboufaki, and
commanded them to take their seats instantly. Four days and
four nights she continued her route without interruption. On
the fifth, she traversed craggy mountains and half-burnt
forests; and arrived on the sixth before the beautiful screens
which concealed from all eyes the voluptuous wanderings of
her son.</p>

<p>It was daybreak, and the guards were snoring on their posts
in careless security, when the rough trot of Alboufaki awoke
them in consternation. Imagining that a group of spectres,
ascended from the abyss, was approaching, they all, without
ceremony, took to their heels. Vathek was at that instant
with Nouronihar in the bath, hearing tales, and laughing at
Bababalouk who related them; but, no sooner did the outcry
of his guards reach him, than he flounced from the water like a
carp, and as soon threw himself back at the sight of Carathis;
who, advancing with her negresses upon Alboufaki, broke
through the muslin awnings and veils of the pavilion. At this
sudden apparition, Nouronihar (for she was not at all times
free from remorse) fancied that the moment of celestial vengeance
was come, and clung about the caliph in amorous
despondence.</p>

<p>Carathis, still seated on her camel, foamed with indignation
at the spectacle which obtruded itself on her chaste view. She
thundered forth without check or mercy, “Thou double-headed
and four-legged monster! what means all this winding and
writhing? Art thou not ashamed to be seen grasping this
limber sapling, in preference to the sceptre of the pre-Adamite
sultans? Is it then for this paltry doxy that thou hast violated
the conditions in the parchment of our Giaour? Is it on her
thou hast lavished thy precious moments? Is this the fruit of
the knowledge I have taught thee? Is this the end of thy
journey? Tear thyself from the arms of this little simpleton;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
drown her in the water before me, and instantly follow my
guidance.”</p>

<p>In the first ebullition of his fury, Vathek had resolved to rip
open the body of Alboufaki, and to stuff it with those of the
negresses and of Carathis herself; but the remembrance of the
Giaour, the palace of Istakar, the sabres, and the talismans,
flashing before his imagination with the simultaneousness of
lightning, he became more moderate, and said to his mother
in a civil, but decisive tone, “Dread lady, you shall be obeyed;
but I will not drown Nouronihar. She is sweeter to me than a
Myrabolan comfit;<a href="#Note_260a" name="Note_121" id="Note_121" class="nanchor">*</a> and is enamoured of carbuncles, especially
that of Giamschid, which hath also been promised to be conferred
upon her: she, therefore, shall go along with us; for I
intend to repose with her upon the sofas of Soliman: I can
sleep no more without her.”&mdash;“Be it so,” replied Carathis,
alighting, and at the same time committing Alboufaki to the
charge of her black women.</p>

<p>Nouronihar, who had not yet quitted her hold, began to take
courage; and said, with an accent of fondness to the caliph,
“Dear sovereign of my soul! I will follow thee, if it be thy
will, beyond the Kaf, in the land of the afrits. I will not
hesitate to climb, for thee, the nest of the Simurgh; who, this
lady excepted, is the most awful of created beings.”&mdash;“We
have here, then,” subjoined Carathis, “a girl both of courage
and science!” Nouronihar had certainly both; but, notwithstanding
all her firmness, she could not help casting back a
thought of regret upon the graces of her little Gulchenrouz,
and the days of tender endearments she had participated with
him. She even dropped a few tears, which the caliph observed;
and inadvertently breathed out with a sigh, “Alas! my gentle
cousin, what will become of thee?” Vathek, at this apostrophe,
knitted up his brows, and Carathis inquired what it could
mean. “She is preposterously sighing after a stripling with
languishing eyes and soft hair, who loves her,” said the caliph.&mdash;“Where
is he?” asked Carathis. “I must be acquainted
with this pretty child; for,” added she, lowering her voice, “I
design, before I depart, to regain the favour of the Giaour.
There is nothing so delicious, in his estimation, as the heart
of a delicate boy palpitating with the first tumults of love.”</p>

<p>Vathek, as he came from the bath, commanded Bababalouk
to collect the women and other movables of his harem, embody
his troops, and hold himself in readiness to march within three
days; whilst Carathis retired alone to a tent, where the Giaour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
solaced her with encouraging visions: but at length waking, she
found at her feet Nerkes and Cafour, who informed her, by their
signs, that having led Alboufaki to the borders of a lake, to
browse on some grey moss that looked tolerably venomous,
they had discovered certain blue fishes,<a href="#Note_261a" name="Note_122" id="Note_122" class="nanchor">*</a> of the same kind with
those in the reservoir on the top of the tower. “Ah! ha!” said
she, “I will go thither to them. These fish are, past doubt, of a
species that, by a small operation, I can render oracular. They
may tell me where this little Gulchenrouz is, whom I am bent
upon sacrificing.” Having thus spoken, she immediately set
out with her swarthy retinue.</p>

<p>It being but seldom that time is lost in the accomplishment
of a wicked enterprise, Carathis and her negresses soon arrived
at the lake; where, after burning the magical drugs with which
they were always provided, they stripped themselves naked,
and waded to their chins; Nerkes and Cafour waving torches
around them, and Carathis pronouncing her barbarous incantations.
The fishes, with one accord, thrust forth their heads
from the water, which was violently rippled by the flutter of
their fins; and at length finding themselves constrained by
the potency of the charm, they opened their piteous mouths,
and said, “From gills to tail, we are yours; what seek ye to
know?”&mdash;“Fishes,” answered she, “I conjure you, by your
glittering scales, tell me where now is Gulchenrouz?”&mdash;“Beyond
the rock,” replied the shoal, in full chorus; “will this content
you? for we do not delight in expanding our mouths.”&mdash;“It
will,” returned the princess; “I am not to learn that you are
not used to long conversations; I will leave you therefore to
repose, though I had other questions to propound.” The
instant she had spoken, the water became smooth, and the
fishes at once disappeared.</p>

<p>Carathis, inflated with the venom of her projects, strode
hastily over the rock, and found the amiable Gulchenrouz
asleep in an arbour, whilst the two dwarfs were watching at
his side, and ruminating their accustomed prayers. These
diminutive personages possessed the gift of divining whenever
an enemy to good Mussulmans approached; thus they anticipated
the arrival of Carathis, who, stopping short, said to
herself, “How placidly doth he recline his lovely little head!
how pale and languishing are his looks! it is just the very child
of my wishes!” The dwarfs interrupted this delectable soliloquy
by leaping instantly upon her, and scratching her face with their
utmost zeal. But Nerkes and Cafour, betaking themselves to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the succour of their mistress, pinched the dwarfs so severely
in return, that they both gave up the ghost, imploring Mahomet
to inflict his sorest vengeance upon this wicked woman and all
her household.</p>

<p>At the noise which this strange conflict occasioned in the
valley, Gulchenrouz awoke, and, bewildered with terror, sprung
impetuously and climbed an old fig-tree that rose against the
acclivity of the rocks; from thence he gained their summits,
and ran for two hours without once looking back. At last,
exhausted with fatigue, he fell senseless into the arms of a good
old genius, whose fondness for the company of children had
made it his sole occupation to protect them. Whilst performing
his wonted rounds through the air, he had pounced on the
cruel Giaour, at the instant of his growling in the horrible
chasm, and had rescued the fifty little victims which the impiety
of Vathek had devoted to his voracity. These the genius brought
up in nests still higher than the clouds, and himself fixed his
abode in a nest more capacious than the rest, from which he
had expelled the rocs that had built it.</p>

<p>These inviolable asylums were defended against the dives
and the afrits by waving streamers; on which were inscribed
in characters of gold, that flashed like lightning, the names of
Alla and the Prophet.<a href="#Note_262a" name="Note_123" id="Note_123" class="nanchor">*</a> It was there that Gulchenrouz, who
as yet remained undeceived with respect to his pretended death,
thought himself in the mansions of eternal peace. He admitted
without fear the congratulations of his little friends, who were all
assembled in the nest of the venerable genius, and vied with
each other in kissing his serene forehead and beautiful eyelids.
Remote from the inquietudes of the world, the impertinence
of harems, the brutality of eunuchs, and the inconstancy of
women, there he found a place truly congenial to the delights
of his soul. In this peaceable society his days, months, and
years glided on; nor was he less happy than the rest of his companions:
for the genius, instead of burdening his pupils with
perishable riches and vain sciences, conferred upon them the
boon of perpetual childhood.</p>

<p>Carathis, unaccustomed to the loss of her prey, vented a
thousand execrations on her negresses, for not seizing the child,
instead of amusing themselves with pinching to death two
insignificant dwarfs from which they could gain no advantage.
She returned into the valley murmuring; and, finding that her
son was not risen from the arms of Nouronihar, discharged her
ill-humour upon both. The idea, however, of departing next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
day for Istakar, and of cultivating, through the good offices
of the Giaour, an intimacy with Eblis himself, at length
consoled her chagrin. But fate had ordained it otherwise.</p>

<p>In the evening, as Carathis was conversing with Dilara,
who through her contrivance had become of the party, and whose
taste resembled her own, Bababalouk came to acquaint her
that the sky towards Samarah looked of a fiery red, and seemed
to portend some alarming disaster. Immediately recurring
to her astrolabes<a href="#Note_263a" name="Note_124" id="Note_124" class="nanchor">*</a> and instruments of magic, she took the altitude
of the planets, and discovered, by her calculations, to her great
mortification, that a formidable revolt had taken place at
Samarah, that Motavakel, availing himself of the disgust
which was inveterate against his brother, had incited commotions
amongst the populace, made himself master of the palace,
and actually invested the great tower, to which Morakanabad
had retired, with a handful of the few that still remained faithful
to Vathek.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed she; “must I lose, then, my tower!
my mutes! my negresses! my mummies! and, worse than all,
the laboratory, the favourite resort of my nightly lucubrations,
without knowing, at least, if my hare-brained son will complete
his adventure? No! I will not be the dupe! immediately will I
speed to support Morakanabad. By my formidable art, the
clouds shall pour grape-shot in the faces of the assailants, and
shafts of red-hot iron on their heads. I will let loose my stores
of hungry serpents and torpedoes from beneath them; and we
shall soon see the stand they will make against such an explosion!”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Carathis hasted to her son, who was
tranquilly banqueting with Nouronihar in his superb carnation-coloured
tent. “Glutton that thou art!” cried she; “were it
not for me, thou wouldst soon find thyself the mere commander
of savoury pies. Thy faithful subjects have abjured the faith
they swore to thee. Motavakel, thy brother, now reigns on
the hill of Pied Horses, and, had I not some slight resources in
the tower, would not be easily persuaded to abdicate. But,
that time may not be lost, I shall only add a few words: Strike
tent to-night; set forward; and beware how thou loiterest again
by the way. Though thou hast forfeited the conditions of the
parchment, I am not yet without hope; for it cannot be denied
that thou hast violated, to admiration, the laws of hospitality
by seducing the daughter of the emir, after having partaken
of his bread and his salt. Such a conduct cannot but be delightful
to the Giaour; and if, on thy march, thou canst signalize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
thyself by an additional crime, all will still go well, and thou
shalt enter the palace of Soliman in triumph. Adieu! Alboufaki
and my negresses are waiting at the door.”</p>

<p>The caliph had nothing to offer in reply: he wished his mother
a prosperous journey, and ate on till he had finished his supper.
At midnight the camp broke up, amidst the flourishing of
trumpets and other martial instruments; but loud indeed
must have been the sound of the timbals, to overpower the
blubbering of the emir and his grey-beards; who, by an excessive
profusion of tears, had so far exhausted the radical moisture,
that their eyes shrivelled up in their sockets, and their hairs
dropped off by the roots. Nouronihar, to whom such a symphony
was painful, did not grieve to get out of hearing. She
accompanied the caliph in the imperial litter, where they
amused themselves with imagining the splendour which was
soon to surround them. The other women, overcome with
dejection, were dolefully rocked in their cages; whilst Dilara
consoled herself with anticipating the joy of celebrating the
rites of fire on the stately terraces of Istakar.</p>

<p>In four days they reached the spacious valley of Rocnabad.
The season of spring was in all its vigour; and the grotesque
branches of the almond trees in full blossom, fantastically
chequered with hyacinths and jonquils, breathed forth a delightful
fragrance. Myriads of bees, and scarce fewer of santons,
had there taken up their abode. On the banks of the stream,
hives and oratories<a href="#Note_264a" name="Note_125" id="Note_125" class="nanchor">*</a> were alternately ranged; and their neatness
and whiteness were set off by the deep green of the cypresses
that spired up amongst them. These pious personages amused
themselves with cultivating little gardens, that abounded with
flowers and fruits; especially musk-melons of the best flavour
that Persia could boast. Sometimes dispersed over the meadow,
they entertained themselves with feeding peacocks whiter than
snow, and turtles more blue than the sapphire. In this manner
were they occupied when the harbingers of the imperial procession
began to proclaim, “Inhabitants of Rocnabad! prostrate
yourselves on the brink of your pure waters; and tender your
thanksgivings to Heaven, that vouchsafeth to show you a ray
of its glory: for, lo! the commander of the faithful draws near.”</p>

<p>The poor santons, filled with holy energy, having bustled to
light up wax torches in their oratories, and expand the Koran
on their ebony desks, went forth to meet the caliph with baskets
of honeycomb, dates, and melons. But, whilst they were
advancing in solemn procession and with measured steps, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
horses, camels, and guards wantoned over their tulips and
other flowers, and made a terrible havoc amongst them. The
santons could not help casting from one eye a look of pity on
the ravages committing around them; whilst the other was
fixed upon the caliph and heaven. Nouronihar, enraptured
with the scenery of a place which brought back to her
remembrance the pleasing solitudes where her infancy had
passed, entreated Vathek to stop: but he, suspecting that these
oratories might be deemed by the Giaour an habitation,
commanded his pioneers to level them all. The santons stood
motionless with horror at the barbarous mandate, and at last
broke out into lamentations; but these were uttered with so
ill a grace, that Vathek bade his eunuchs to kick them from his
presence. He then descended from the litter with Nouronihar.
They sauntered together in the meadow; and amused themselves
with culling flowers, and passing a thousand pleasantries on
each other. But the bees, who were staunch Mussulmans,
thinking it their duty to revenge the insult offered to their
dear masters the santons, assembled so zealously to do it with
good effect, that the caliph and Nouronihar were glad to find
their tents prepared to receive them.</p>

<p>Bababalouk, who, in capacity of purveyor, had acquitted
himself with applause as to peacocks and turtles, lost no time
in consigning some dozens to the spit, and as many more to
be fricasseed. Whilst they were feasting, laughing, carousing,
and blaspheming at pleasure on the banquet so liberally
furnished, the moullahs, the sheiks, the cadis,<a href="#Note_265a" name="Note_126" id="Note_126" class="nanchor">*</a> and imans of
Schiraz (who seemed not to have met the santons) arrived;
leading by bridles of riband, inscribed from the Koran,<a href="#Note_265b" name="Note_127" id="Note_127" class="nanchor">*</a> a train
of asses which were loaded with the choicest fruits the country
could boast. Having presented their offerings to the caliph,
they petitioned him to honour their city and mosques with his
presence. “Fancy not,” said Vathek, “that you can detain me.
Your presence I condescend to accept, but beg you will let me
be quiet, for I am not over-fond of resisting temptation. Retire,
then; yet, as it is not decent for personages so reverend to
return on foot, and as you have not the appearance of expert
riders, my eunuchs shall tie you on your asses, with the precaution
that your backs be not turned towards me; for they
understand etiquette.”&mdash;In this deputation were some high-stomached
sheiks, who, taking Vathek for a fool, scrupled not
to speak their opinion. These Bababalouk girded with double
cords; and having well disciplined their asses with nettles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
behind, they all started, with a preternatural alertness, plunging,
kicking, and running foul of one another, in the most ludicrous
manner imaginable.</p>

<p>Nouronihar and the caliph mutually contended who should
most enjoy so degrading a sight. They burst out in peals of
laughter to see the old men and their asses fall into the stream.
The leg of one was fractured; the shoulder of another dislocated;
the teeth of a third dashed out; and the rest suffered still worse.</p>

<p>Two days more, undisturbed by fresh embassies, having been
devoted to the pleasures of Rocnabad, the expedition proceeded;
leaving Schiraz on the right, and verging towards a large plain;
from whence were discernible, on the edge of the horizon, the
dark summits of the mountains of Istakar.</p>

<p>At this prospect the caliph and Nouronihar were unable to
repress their transports. They bounded from their litter to the
ground, and broke forth into such wild exclamations, as amazed
all within hearing. Interrogating each other, they shouted,
“Are we not approaching the radiant palace of light? or gardens,
more delightful than those of Sheddad?”&mdash;Infatuated mortals!
they thus indulged delusive conjecture, unable to fathom the
decrees of the Most High!</p>

<p>The good genii, who had not totally relinquished the superintendence
of Vathek, repairing to Mahomet in the seventh
heaven, said, “Merciful Prophet! stretch forth thy propitious
arms towards thy vicegerent; who is ready to fall, irretrievably,
into the snare which his enemies, the dives, have prepared to
destroy him. The Giaour is awaiting his arrival, in the abominable
palace of fire; where, if he once set his foot, his perdition
will be inevitable.” Mahomet answered, with an air of indignation,
“He hath too well deserved to be resigned to himself;
but I permit you to try if one effort more will be effectual to
divert him from pursuing his ruin.”</p>

<p>One of these beneficent genii, assuming, without delay, the
exterior of a shepherd, more renowned for his piety than all
the dervishes and santons of the region, took his station near
a flock of white sheep, on the slope of a hill; and began to pour
forth from his flute<a href="#Note_266a" name="Note_128" id="Note_128" class="nanchor">*</a> such airs of pathetic melody, as subdued
the very soul, and, wakening remorse, drove far from it every
frivolous fancy. At these energetic sounds, the sun hid himself
beneath a gloomy cloud; and the waters of two little lakes, that
were naturally clearer than crystal, became of a colour like
blood. The whole of this superb assembly was involuntarily
drawn towards the declivity of the hill.<a href="#Note_266b" name="Note_129" id="Note_129" class="nanchor">*</a>
With downcast eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
they all stood abashed; each upbraiding himself with the evil
he had done. The heart of Dilara palpitated; and the chief of
the eunuchs, with a sigh of contrition, implored pardon of
the women, whom, for his own satisfaction, he had so often
tormented.</p>

<p>Vathek and Nouronihar turned pale in their litter; and,
regarding each other with haggard looks, reproached themselves&mdash;the
one with a thousand of the blackest crimes, a
thousand projects of impious ambition; the other with the
desolation of her family, and the perdition of the amiable
Gulchenrouz. Nouronihar persuaded herself that she heard, in
the fatal music, the groans of her dying father; and Vathek,
the sobs of the fifty children he had sacrificed to the Giaour.
Amidst these complicated pangs of anguish, they perceived
themselves impelled towards the shepherd, whose countenance
was so commanding that Vathek, for the first time, felt overawed;
whilst Nouronihar concealed her face with her hands.
The music paused; and the genius, addressing the caliph, said,
“Deluded prince! to whom Providence hath confided the care of
innumerable subjects, is it thus that thou fulfillest thy mission?
Thy crimes are already completed; and art thou now listening
towards thy punishment? Thou knowest that, beyond these
mountains, Eblis<a href="#Note_267a" name="Note_130" id="Note_130" class="nanchor">*</a> and his accursed dives hold their infernal
empire; and, seduced by a malignant phantom, thou art proceeding
to surrender thyself to them! This moment is the last
of grace allowed thee: abandon thy atrocious purpose: return:
give back Nouronihar to her father, who still retains a few
sparks of life: destroy thy tower with all its abominations:
drive Carathis from thy councils: be just to thy subjects:
respect the ministers of the Prophet: compensate for thy
impieties by an exemplary life;<a href="#Note_267b" name="Note_131" id="Note_131" class="nanchor">*</a> and, instead of squandering
thy days in voluptuous indulgence, lament thy crimes on the
sepulchres of thy ancestors. Thou beholdest the clouds that
obscure the sun: at the instant he recovers his splendour, if
thy heart be not changed, the time of mercy assigned thee will
be past for ever.”</p>

<p>Vathek, depressed with fear, was on the point of prostrating
himself at the feet of the shepherd, whom he perceived to be
of a nature superior to man: but, his pride prevailing, he
audaciously lifted his head, and, glancing at him one of his
terrible looks, said, “Whoever thou art, withhold thy useless
admonitions: thou wouldst either delude me, or art thyself
deceived. If what I have done be so criminal as thou pretendest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
there remains not for me a moment of grace. I have traversed
a sea of blood to acquire a power which will make thy equals
tremble; deem not that I shall retire when in view of the port,
or that I will relinquish her who is dearer to me than either
my life or thy mercy. Let the sun appear! let him illume my
career! it matters not where it may end.” On uttering these
words, which made even the genius shudder, Vathek threw himself
into the arms of Nouronihar, and commanded that his
horses should be forced back to the road.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in obeying these orders, for the
attraction had ceased: the sun shone forth in all his glory, and
the shepherd vanished with a lamentable scream.</p>

<p>The fatal impression of the music of the genius remained,
notwithstanding, in the heart of Vathek’s attendants. They
viewed each other with looks of consternation. At the approach
of night almost all of them escaped; and of this numerous
assemblage there only remained the chief of the eunuchs, some
idolatrous slaves, Dilara, and a few other women who, like
herself, were votaries of the religion of the Magi.</p>

<p>The caliph, fired with the ambition of prescribing laws to the
powers of darkness, was but little embarrassed at this dereliction.
The impetuosity of his blood prevented him from sleeping; nor
did he encamp any more as before. Nouronihar, whose
impatience, if possible, exceeded his own, importuned him to
hasten his march, and lavished on him a thousand caresses, to
beguile all reflection. She fancied herself already more potent
than Balkis,<a href="#Note_268a" name="Note_132" id="Note_132" class="nanchor">*</a> and pictured to her imagination the genii falling
prostrate at the foot of her throne. In this manner they
advanced by moonlight till they came within view of the two
towering rocks that form a kind of portal to the valley, at the
extremity of which rose the vast ruins of Istakar. Aloft on
the mountain glimmered the fronts of various royal mausoleums,
the horror of which was deepened by the shadows of night.
They passed through two villages almost deserted, the only
inhabitants remaining being a few feeble old men, who, at the
sight of horses and litters, fell upon their knees, and cried out,
“O Heaven! is it then by these phantoms that we have been
for six months tormented? Alas! it was from the terror of
these spectres, and the noise beneath the mountains, that our
people have fled, and left us at the mercy of the maleficent
spirits!” The caliph, to whom these complaints were but unpromising
auguries, drove over the bodies of these wretched
old men, and at length arrived at the foot of the terrace of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
black marble. There he descended from his litter, handing
down Nouronihar. Both with beating hearts stared wildly
around them, and expected, with an apprehensive shudder,
the approach of the Giaour; but nothing as yet announced
his appearance.</p>

<p>A deathlike stillness reigned over the mountain and through
the air; the moon dilated on a vast platform the shades of the
lofty columns, which reached from the terrace almost to the
clouds; the gloomy watch-towers, whose number could not be
counted, were covered by no roof; and their capitals, of an
architecture unknown in the records of the earth, served as an
asylum for the birds of night, which, alarmed at the approach
of such visitants, fled away croaking.</p>

<p>The chief of the eunuchs, trembling with fear, besought
Vathek that a fire might be kindled. “No,” replied he, “there
is no time left to think of such trifles. Abide where thou art,
and expect my commands.” Having thus spoken, he presented
his hand to Nouronihar; and ascending the steps of a vast
staircase, reached the terrace, which was flagged with squares
of marble, and resembled a smooth expanse of water, upon
whose surface not a blade of grass ever dared to vegetate. On
the right rose the watch-towers, ranged before the ruins of an
immense palace, whose walls were embossed with various
figures. In front stood forth the colossal forms of four creatures,
composed of the leopard and the griffin, and though but of
stone, inspired emotions of terror. Near these were distinguished,
by the splendour of the moon, which streamed full on
the place, characters like those on the sabres of the Giaour, and
which possessed the same virtue of changing every moment.
These, after vacillating for some time, fixed at last in Arabic
letters, and prescribed to the caliph the following words:
“Vathek, thou hast violated the conditions of my parchment,
and deservest to be sent back; but in favour to thy companion,
and as the meed for what thou hast done to obtain it, Eblis
permitteth that the portal of his palace shall be opened,
and the subterranean fire will receive thee into the number
of its adorers.”</p>

<p>He scarcely had read these words before the mountain,
against which the terrace was reared, trembled, and the watch-towers
were ready to topple headlong upon them; the rock
yawned, and disclosed within it a staircase of polished marble,
that seemed to approach the abyss. Upon each stair were
planted two large torches, like those Nouronihar had seen in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
vision, the camphorated vapour of which ascended and gathered
itself into a cloud under the hollow of the vault.</p>

<p>This appearance, instead of terrifying, gave new courage to
the daughter of Fakreddin. Scarcely deigning to bid adieu to
the moon and the firmament, she abandoned without hesitation
the pure atmosphere, to plunge into these infernal exhalations.
The gait of those impious personages was haughty and determined.
As they descended, by the effulgence of the torches,
they gazed on each other with mutual admiration, and both
appeared so resplendent that they already esteemed themselves
spiritual intelligences. The only circumstance that perplexed
them was their not arriving at the bottom of the stairs: on
hastening their descent with an ardent impetuosity, they felt
their steps accelerated to such a degree, that they seemed not
walking but falling from a precipice. Their progress, however,
was at length impeded by a vast portal of ebony, which the
caliph without difficulty recognized. Here the Giaour awaited
them with the key in his hand. “Ye are welcome!” said he to
them, with a ghastly smile, “in spite of Mahomet and all his
dependents. I will now usher you into that palace where you
have so highly merited a place.” Whilst he was uttering these
words he touched the enamelled lock with his key, and the
doors at once flew open with a noise still louder than the thunder
of the dog-days, and as suddenly recoiled the moment they
had entered.</p>

<p>The caliph and Nouronihar beheld each other with amazement
at finding themselves in a place which, though roofed
with a vaulted ceiling, was so spacious and lofty, that at first
they took it for an immeasurable plain. But their eyes at length
growing familiar to the grandeur of the surrounding objects,
they extended their view to those at a distance, and discovered
rows of columns and arcades, which gradually diminished, till
they terminated in a point radiant as the sun when he darts his
last beams athwart the ocean. The pavement, strewed over
with gold dust and saffron,<a href="#Note_270a" name="Note_133" id="Note_133" class="nanchor">*</a> exhaled so subtle an odour as almost
overpowered them. They, however, went on, and observed
an infinity of censers, in which ambergris and the wood of
aloes were continually burning. Between the several columns
were placed tables, each spread with a profusion of viands,
and wines of every species sparkling in vases of crystal. A
throng of genii and other fantastic spirits of either sex danced
lasciviously at the sound of music which issued from beneath.</p>

<p>In the midst of this immense hall, a vast multitude was incessantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
passing, who severally kept their right hands on their
hearts, without once regarding anything around them: they
had all the livid paleness of death. Their eyes, deep sunk in
their sockets, resembled those phosphoric meteors that glimmer
by night in places of interment. Some stalked slowly on,
absorbed in profound reverie; some, shrieking with agony, ran
furiously about like tigers wounded with poisoned arrows;
whilst others, grinding their teeth in rage, foamed along more
frantic than the wildest maniac. They all avoided each other;
and, though surrounded by a multitude that no one could
number, each wandered at random unheedful of the rest, as
if alone on a desert where no foot had trodden.</p>

<p>Vathek and Nouronihar, frozen with terror at a sight so
baleful, demanded of the Giaour what these appearances might
mean, and why these ambulating spectres never withdrew their
hands from their hearts? “Perplex not yourselves with so
much at once,” replied he bluntly; “you will soon be acquainted
with all: let us haste and present you to Eblis.” They continued
their way through the multitude: but, notwithstanding
their confidence at first, they were not sufficiently composed
to examine with attention the various perspectives of halls and
of galleries that opened on the right hand and left; which were
all illuminated by torches and braziers, whose flames rose in
pyramids to the centre of the vault. At length they came to
a place where long curtains, brocaded with crimson and gold,
fell from all parts in solemn confusion. Here the choirs and
dances were heard no longer. The light which glimmered
came from afar.</p>

<p>After some time, Vathek and Nouronihar perceived a gleam
brightening through the drapery, and entered a vast tabernacle
hung round with the skins of leopards. An infinity of elders
with streaming beards, and afrits in complete armour, had
prostrated themselves before the ascent of a lofty eminence;
on the top of which, upon a globe of fire, sat the formidable
Eblis. His person was that of a young man, whose noble and
regular features seemed to have been tarnished by malignant
vapours. In his large eyes appeared both pride and despair:
his flowing hair retained some resemblance to that of an angel
of light. In his hand, which thunder had blasted, he swayed
the iron sceptre that causes the monster Ouranbad,<a href="#Note_271a" name="Note_134" id="Note_134" class="nanchor">*</a> the afrits,
and all the powers of the abyss to tremble. At his presence,
the heart of the caliph sunk within him; and he fell prostrate
on his face. Nouronihar, however, though greatly dismayed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
could not help admiring the person of Eblis; for she expected
to have seen some stupendous giant. Eblis, with a voice more
mild than might be imagined, but such as penetrated the soul
and filled it with the deepest melancholy, said, “Creatures of
clay,<a href="#Note_272a" name="Note_135" id="Note_135" class="nanchor">*</a> I receive you into mine empire: ye are numbered amongst
my adorers: enjoy whatever this palace affords: the treasures
of the pre-Adamite sultans, their fulminating sabres, and those
talismans that compel the dives to open the subterranean
expanses of the mountain of Kaf, which communicate with these.
There, insatiable as your curiosity may be, shall you find
sufficient objects to gratify it. You shall possess the exclusive
privilege of entering the fortresses of Aherman,<a href="#Note_272b" name="Note_136" id="Note_136" class="nanchor">*</a> and the halls
of Argenk,<a href="#Note_272c" name="Note_137" id="Note_137" class="nanchor">*</a> where are portrayed all creatures endowed with
intelligence; and the various animals that inhabited the earth
prior to the creation of that contemptible being whom ye
denominate the father of mankind.”</p>

<p>Vathek and Nouronihar, feeling themselves revived and
encouraged by this harangue, eagerly said to the Giaour,
“Bring us instantly to the place which contains these precious
talismans.”&mdash;“Come,” answered this wicked dive, with his
malignant grin&mdash;“come and possess all that my sovereign hath
promised, and more.” He then conducted them into a long
aisle adjoining the tabernacle; preceding them with hasty
steps, and followed by his disciples with the utmost alacrity.
They reached, at length, a hall of great extent, and covered
with a lofty dome; around which appeared fifty portals of bronze,
secured with as many fastenings of iron. A funereal gloom
prevailed over the whole scene. Here, upon two beds of incorruptible
cedar, lay recumbent the fleshless forms of the pre-Adamite
kings, who had been monarchs of the whole earth.
They still possessed enough of life to be conscious of their
deplorable condition. Their eyes retained a melancholy motion;
they regarded one another with looks of the deepest dejection,
each holding his right hand, motionless, on his heart.<a href="#Note_272d" name="Note_138" id="Note_138" class="nanchor">*</a> At their
feet were inscribed the events of their several reigns, their
power, their pride, and their crimes; Soliman Raad, Soliman
Daki, and Soliman, called Gian Ben Gian, who, after having
chained up the dives in the dark caverns of Kaf, became so
presumptuous as to doubt of the Supreme Power. All these
maintained great state, though not to be compared with the
eminence of Soliman Ben Daoud.</p>

<p>This king, so renowned for his wisdom, was on the loftiest
elevation, and placed immediately under the dome. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
appeared to possess more animation than the rest. Though,
from time to time, he laboured with profound sighs; and, like
his companions, kept his right hand on his heart, yet his countenance
was more composed, and he seemed to be listening to
the sullen roar of a cataract visible in part through one of the
grated portals. This was the only sound that intruded on
the silence of these doleful mansions. A range of brazen cases
surrounded the elevation. “Remove the covers from these
cabalistic depositories,” said the Giaour to Vathek, “and avail
thyself of the talismans which will break asunder all these
gates of bronze, and not only render thee master of the treasures
contained within them, but also of the spirits by which they
are guarded.”</p>

<p>The caliph, whom this ominous preliminary had entirely
disconcerted, approached the vase with faltering footsteps;
and was ready to sink with terror when he heard the groans
of Soliman. As he proceeded, a voice from the livid lips of
the prophet articulated these words: “In my lifetime I filled<a href="#Note_273a" name="Note_139" id="Note_139" class="nanchor">*</a>
a magnificent throne; having, on my right hand, twelve thousand
seats of gold, where the patriarchs and the prophets heard
my doctrines: on my left, the sages and doctors, upon as many
thrones of silver, were present at all my decisions. Whilst I
thus administered justice to innumerable multitudes, the birds
of the air, hovering over me, served as a canopy against the
rays of the sun. My people flourished; and my palace rose to
the clouds. I erected a temple to the Most High, which was
the wonder of the universe; but I basely suffered myself to be
seduced by the love of women, and a curiosity that could not
be restrained by sublunary things. I listened to the counsels
of Aherman and the daughter of Pharaoh; and adored fire
and the hosts of heaven. I forsook the holy city, and commanded
the genii to rear the stupendous palace of Istakar, and
the terrace of the watch-towers; each of which was consecrated
to a star. There, for a while, I enjoyed myself in the zenith
of glory and pleasure. Not only men but supernatural beings
were subject also to my will. I began to think, as these unhappy
monarchs around had already thought, that the vengeance of
Heaven was asleep; when, at once, the thunder burst my structures
asunder, and precipitated me hither: where, however, I
do not remain, like the other inhabitants, totally destitute of
hope; for an angel of light hath revealed that in consideration of
the piety of my early youth my woes shall come to an end,
when this cataract shall for ever cease to flow. Till then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
I am in torments, ineffable torments! an unrelenting fire preys
on my heart.”<a href="#Note_274a" name="Note_140" id="Note_140" class="nanchor">*</a></p>

<p>Having uttered this exclamation, Soliman raised his hands
towards heaven, in token of supplication; and the caliph
discerned through his bosom, which was transparent as crystal,
his heart enveloped in flames. At a sight so full of horror,
Nouronihar fell back, like one petrified, into the arms of Vathek,
who cried out with a convulsive sob, “O Giaour! whither hast
thou brought us! Allow us to depart, and I will relinquish
all thou hast promised. O Mahomet! remains there no more
mercy?”&mdash;“None! none!” replied the malicious dive. “Know,
miserable prince! thou art now in the abode of vengeance and
despair. Thy heart, also, will be kindled like those of the other
votaries of Eblis. A few days are allotted thee previous to this
fatal period: employ them as thou wilt; recline on these heaps
of gold; command the infernal potentates; range, at thy pleasure,
through these immense subterranean domains: no barrier shall
be shut against thee. As for me, I have fulfilled my mission:
I now leave thee to thyself.” At these words he vanished.</p>

<p>The caliph and Nouronihar remained in the most abject
affliction. Their tears were unable to flow, and scarcely could
they support themselves. At length, taking each other despondingly
by the hand, they went faltering from this fatal
hall, indifferent which way they turned their steps. Every
portal opened at their approach. The dives fell prostrate
before them. Every reservoir of riches was disclosed to their
view; but they no longer felt the incentives of curiosity, of
pride, or avarice. With like apathy they heard the chorus of
genii, and saw the stately banquets prepared to regale them.
They went wandering on, from chamber to chamber, hall to
hall, and gallery to gallery; all without bounds or limit; all
distinguishable by the same lowering gloom; all adorned with
the same awful grandeur; all traversed by persons in search of
repose and consolation, but who sought them in vain; for every
one carried within him a heart tormented in flames. Shunned
by these various sufferers, who seemed by their looks to be
upbraiding the partners of their guilt, they withdrew from
them to wait, in direful suspense, the moment which should
render them to each other the like objects of terror.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Nouronihar; “will the time come when
I shall snatch my hand from thine?”&mdash;“Ah!” said Vathek,
“and shall my eyes ever cease to drink from thine long draughts
of enjoyment? Shall the moments of our reciprocal ecstasies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
be reflected on with horror? It was not thou that broughtest
me hither; the principles by which Carathis perverted my
youth have been the sole cause of my perdition! it is but right
she should have her share of it.” Having given vent to these
painful expressions, he called to an afrit, who was stirring up
one of the braziers, and bade him fetch the Princess Carathis
from the palace of Samarah.</p>

<p>After issuing these orders, the caliph and Nouronihar continued
walking amidst the silent crowd, till they heard voices
at the end of the gallery. Presuming them to proceed from
some unhappy beings, who, like themselves, were awaiting their
final doom, they followed the sound, and found it to come from
a small square chamber, where they discovered, sitting on sofas,
four young men of goodly figure, and a lovely female, who
were holding a melancholy conversation by the glimmering of
a lonely lamp. Each had a gloomy and forlorn air; and two
of them were embracing each other with great tenderness. On
seeing the caliph and the daughter of Fakreddin enter, they
arose, saluted, and made room for them. Then he who appeared
the most considerable of the group, addressed himself thus to
Vathek: “Strangers! who doubtless are in the same state of
suspense with ourselves, as you do not yet bear your hand on
your heart, if you come hither to pass the interval allotted,
previous to the infliction of our common punishment, condescend
to relate the adventures that have brought you to this fatal
place; and we, in return, will acquaint you with ours, which
deserve but too well to be heard. To trace back our crimes
to their source, though we are not permitted to repent, is the
only employment suited to wretches like us!”</p>

<p>The caliph and Nouronihar assented to the proposal; and
Vathek began, not without tears and lamentations, a sincere
recital of every circumstance that had passed. When the
afflicting narrative was closed, the young man entered on his
own. Each person proceeded in order; and, when the third
prince had reached the midst of his adventures, a sudden noise
interrupted him, which caused the vault to tremble and to open.</p>

<p>Immediately a cloud descended, which, gradually dissipating,
discovered Carathis on the back of an afrit,<a href="#Note_275a" name="Note_141" id="Note_141" class="nanchor">*</a> who grievously
complained of his burden. She, instantly springing to the
ground, advanced towards her son, and said, “What dost thou
here, in this little square chamber? As the dives are become
subject to thy beck, I expected to have found thee on the
throne of the pre-Adamite kings.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
“Execrable woman!” answered the caliph; “cursed be the
day thou gavest me birth! Go, follow this afrit; let him conduct
thee to the hall of the prophet Soliman: there thou wilt learn
to what these palaces are destined, and how much I ought to
abhor the impious knowledge thou hast taught me.”</p>

<p>“Has the height of power, to which thou art arrived, turned
thy brain?” answered Carathis; “but I ask no more than
permission to show my respect for Soliman the prophet. It
is, however, proper thou shouldst know that (as the afrit has
informed me neither of us shall return to Samarah) I requested
his permission to arrange my affairs, and he politely consented.
Availing myself, therefore, of the few moments allowed me, I
set fire to the tower, and consumed in it the mutes, negresses,
and serpents, which have rendered me so much good service;
nor should I have been less kind to Morakanabad, had he not
prevented me, by deserting at last to thy brother. As for
Bababalouk, who had the folly to return to Samarah, to provide
husbands for thy wives, I undoubtedly would have put him to
the torture; but being in a hurry, I only hung him, after having
decoyed him in a snare, with thy wives, whom I buried alive by
the help of my negresses, who thus spent their last moments
greatly to their satisfaction. With respect to Dilara, who ever
stood high in my favour, she hath evinced the greatness of her
mind, by fixing herself near, in the service of one of the magi;
and, I think, will soon be one of our society.”</p>

<p>Vathek, too much cast down to express the indignation excited
by such a discourse, ordered the afrit to remove Carathis from
his presence, and continued immersed in thoughts which his
companions durst not disturb.</p>

<p>Carathis, however, eagerly entered the dome of Soliman, and
without regarding in the least the groans of the prophet, undauntedly
removed the covers of the vases and violently seized
on the talismans. Then, with a voice more loud than had hitherto
been heard within these mansions, she compelled the dives
to disclose to her the most secret treasures, the most profound
stores, which the afrit himself had not seen. She passed, by
rapid descents, known only to Eblis and his most favoured
potentates; and thus penetrated the very entrails of the earth,
where breathes the sansar, or the icy wind of death. Nothing
appalled her dauntless soul. She perceived, however, in all the
inmates who bore their hands on their heart, a little singularity
not much to her taste.</p>

<p>As she was emerging from one of the abysses, Eblis stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
forth to her view; but notwithstanding he displayed the full
effulgence of his infernal majesty, she preserved her countenance
unaltered, and even paid her compliments with considerable
firmness.</p>

<p>This superb monarch thus answered: “Princess, whose
knowledge and whose crimes have merited a conspicuous rank
in my empire, thou dost well to avail thyself of the leisure
that remains; for the flames and torments, which are ready
to seize on thy heart, will not fail to provide thee soon with
full employment.” He said, and was lost in the curtains of
his tabernacle.</p>

<p>Carathis paused for a moment with surprise; but, resolved
to follow the advice of Eblis, she assembled all the choirs of
genii, and all the dives, to pay her homage. Thus marched
she, in triumph, through a vapour of perfumes, amidst the
acclamations of all the malignant spirits, with most of whom
she had formed a previous acquaintance. She even attempted
to dethrone one of the Solimans, for the purpose of usurping
his place; when a voice, proceeding from the abyss of death,
proclaimed, “All is accomplished!” Instantaneously the haughty
forehead of the intrepid princess became corrugated with agony;
she uttered a tremendous yell, and fixed, no more to be withdrawn,
her right hand upon her heart, which was become a
receptacle of eternal fire.</p>

<p>In this delirium, forgetting all ambitious projects, and her
thirst for that knowledge which should ever be hidden from
mortals, she overturned the offerings of the genii; and, having
execrated the hour she was begotten and the womb that had
borne her, glanced off in a rapid whirl that rendered her
invisible,<a href="#Note_277a" name="Note_142" id="Note_142" class="nanchor">*</a> and continued to revolve without intermission.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant, the same voice announced to
the caliph, Nouronihar, the four princes, and the princess, the
awful and irrevocable decree. Their hearts immediately took
fire, and they, at once, lost the most precious gift of heaven&mdash;<span class="ucsmcap">HOPE</span>.
These unhappy beings recoiled, with looks of the most
furious distraction. Vathek beheld in the eyes of Nouronihar
nothing but rage and vengeance; nor could she discern aught
in his but aversion and despair. The two princes who were
friends, and, till that moment, had preserved their attachment,
shrunk back, gnashing their teeth with mutual and unchangeable
hatred. Kahlah and his sister made reciprocal gestures of
imprecation; all testified their horror for each other by the most
ghastly convulsions, and screams that could not be smothered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
All severally plunged themselves into the accursed multitude,
there to wander in an eternity of unabating anguish.</p>

<p>Such was, and such should be, the punishment of unrestrained
passions and atrocious deeds! Such shall be the chastisement
of that blind curiosity, which would transgress those bounds
the wisdom of the Creator has prescribed to human knowledge;
and such the dreadful disappointment of that restless ambition,
which, aiming at discoveries reserved for beings of a supernatural
order, perceives not, through its infatuated pride, that
the condition of man upon earth is to be&mdash;humble and ignorant.</p>

<p>Thus the caliph Vathek, who, for the sake of empty pomp
and forbidden power, had sullied himself with a thousand
crimes, became a prey to grief without end, and remorse without
mitigation; whilst the humble, the despised Gulchenrouz
passed whole ages in undisturbed tranquillity, and in the pure
happiness of childhood.</p>

<p>This title, amongst the Mahometans, comprehends the concrete
character of Prophet, Priest, and King, and is used to signify <i>the
Vicar of God on Earth</i>. It is, at this day, one of the titles of the
Grand Signior, as successor of Mahomet; and of the Sophi of Persia,

Mahomet’s bosom, as a reward for his abstinence in an age of
corruption.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>, p. 690.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_3" name="Note_195c" id="Note_195c">
<span class="smcap">Page 195.</span></a> <i>Samarah</i></h4>

<p>A city of the Babylonian Irak; supposed to have stood on the site
where Nimrod erected his tower. Khondemir relates, in his life
of Motassem, that this prince, to terminate the disputes which were
perpetually happening between the inhabitants of Bagdat and his
Turkish slaves, withdrew from thence, and having fixed on a
situation in the plain of Catoul, there founded Samarah. He is
said to have had, in the stables of this city, a hundred and thirty
thousand <i>pied horses</i>, each of which carried, by his order, a sack
of earth to a place he had chosen. By this accumulation an elevation
was formed that commanded a view of all Samarah, and served
for the foundation of his magnificent palace.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>, pp. 752,

<span class="smcap">Page 195.</span></a> <i>... in the most delightful succession</i></h4>

<p>The great men of the East have been always fond of music.
Though forbidden by the Mahometan religion, it commonly makes
a part of every entertainment. <i>Nitimur in vetitum semper.</i> Female
slaves are generally kept to amuse them and the ladies of their
harems. The Persian Khanyagere seems nearly to have resembled
our old English minstrel; as he usually accompanied his barbut,
or lute, with heroic songs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richardson’s</span> <i>Dissertation on the

<p>This artist, whom Inatulla of Delhi styles <i>the far-famed</i>, lived in the
reign of Schabur, or Sapor, the son of Ardschir Babegan, was founder
of the sect of Manichæans, and was, by profession, a painter and
sculptor. His pretensions, supported by an uncommon skill in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
mechanical contrivances, induced the ignorant to believe that his
powers were more than human. After having secluded himself
from his followers, under the pretence of passing a year in heaven,
he produced a wonderful volume, which he affirmed to have brought
from thence; containing images and figures of a marvellous nature.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>,
p. 458. It appears, from the <i>Arabian Nights</i>,
that Haroun al Raschid, Vathek’s grandfather, had adorned his
palace and furnished his magnificent pavilion with the most capital
performances of the Persian artists.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_6" name="Note_196b" id="Note_196b">
<span class="smcap">Page 196.</span></a> <i>Houris</i></h4>

<p>The virgins of Paradise, called, from their large black eyes,
<i>Hur al oyun</i>. An intercourse with these, according to the institution
of Mahomet, is to constitute the principal felicity of the faithful.
Not formed of clay, like mortal women, they are deemed in the
highest degree beautiful, and exempt from every inconvenience
incident to the sex.&mdash;<i>Al Koran</i>; <i>passim</i>.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_7" name="Note_196c" id="Note_196c">
<span class="smcap">Page 196.</span></a> <i>... it was not with the orthodox that he usually held</i></h4>

<p>Vathek persecuted, with extreme rigour, all who defended the
eternity of the Koran; which the Sonnites, or orthodox, maintained
to be uncreated, and the Motazalites and Schiites as strenuously
denied.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>, p. 85, etc.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_8" name="Note_197a" id="Note_197a">
<span class="smcap">Page 197.</span></a> <i>Mahomet in the seventh heaven</i></h4>

<p>In this heaven, the paradise of Mahomet is supposed to be placed,
contiguous to the throne of Alla. Hagi Khalfah relates, that Ben
Iatmaiah, a celebrated doctor of Damascus, had the temerity to
assert that, when the Most High erected his throne, he reserved a
vacant place for Mahomet upon it.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_9" name="Note_197b" id="Note_197b">
<span class="smcap">Page 197.</span></a> <i>Genii</i></h4>

<p><i>Genn</i>, or <i>Ginn</i>, in the Arabic, signifies a Genius or Demon, a being
of a higher order, and formed of more subtile matter than man.
According to Oriental mythology, the Genii governed the world
long before the creation of Adam. The Mahometans regarded
them as an intermediate race between angels and men, and capable
of salvation; whence Mahomet pretended a commission to convert
them. Consonant to this, we read that, <i>when the</i> Servant of God
<i>stood up to invoke him, it wanted little but that the</i> Genii <i>had pressed on
him in crowds, to hear him rehearse the Koran</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>, p. 375.
<i>Al Koran</i>, ch. 72. It is asserted, and not without plausible reasons,
that the words <i>Genn</i>, <i>Ginn</i>&mdash;<i>Genius</i>, <i>Genie</i>, <i>Gian</i>, <i>Gigas</i>, <i>Giant</i>,
<i>Géant</i>&mdash;proceed from the same themes, viz. <ins class="grk" title="Gê">Γὴ</ins>,
<i>the earth</i>, and <ins class="grk" title="gaô">γάω</ins>, <i>to
produce</i>; as if these supernatural agents had been an early production
of the earth, long before Adam was modelled out from a
lump of it. The <ins class="grk" title="Ôntes">Ωντες</ins> and
<ins class="grk" title="Eôntes">Εωντες</ins> of Plato bear a close analogy to
these supposed intermediate creatures between God and man.
From these premises arose the consequence that, boasting a higher
order, formed of more subtle matter, and possessed of much greater
knowledge, than man, they lorded over this planet, and invisibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
governed it with superior intellect. From this last circumstance
they obtained in Greece the title of <ins class="grk" title="Daimones">Δαίμονες</ins>,
Demons, from <ins class="grk" title="daêmôn">δαήμων</ins>,
<i>sciens</i>, knowing. The Hebrew word, <ins class="hbw" title="NFLIM">נפלים</ins>, Nephilim (Gen. vi, 4),
translated by <i>Gigantes</i>, giants, claiming the same etymon with
<ins class="grk" title="nephelê">νεφέλη</ins>, a cloud, seems also to indicate that these intellectual beings
inhabited the void expanse of the terrestrial atmosphere. Hence
the very ancient fable of men of enormous strength and size revolting
against the gods, and all the mythological lore relating to that
mighty conflict; unless we trace the origin of this important event
to the ambition of Satan, his revolt against the Almighty, and his
fall with the angels.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_10" name="Note_197c" id="Note_197c">
<span class="smcap">Page 197.</span></a> <i>Assist him to complete the tower</i></h4>

<p>The Genii, who were styled by the Persians <i>Peris</i> and <i>Dives</i>, were
famous for their architectural skill. The pyramids of Egypt have
been ascribed to them.</p>

<p>The Koran relates, that the Genii were employed by Solomon in
the erection of his magnificent temple.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bailly</span>, <i>Sur l’Atlantide</i>,

<span class="smcap">Page 198.</span></a> <i>... the stranger displayed such rarities as he had
never before seen</i></h4>

<p>In the <i>Tales of Inatulla</i>, we meet with a traveller who, like this,
was furnished with trinkets and curiosities of an extraordinary kind.
That such were much sought after in the days of Vathek, may be
concluded from the encouragement which Haroun al Raschid gave
to the mechanic arts, and the present he sent by his ambassadors
to Charlemagne. This consisted of a clock, which, when put into
motion, by means of a clepsydra, not only pointed out the hours
in their round, but also, by dropping small balls on a bell, struck
them, and, at the same instant, threw open as many little doors,
to let out an equal number of horsemen. Besides these, the clock
displayed various other contrivances.&mdash;<i>Ann. Reg. Franc. Pip.

<h4><a href="#Note_12" name="Note_198b" id="Note_198b">
<span class="smcap">Page 198.</span></a> <i>... characters on the sabres</i></h4>

<p>Such inscriptions often occur in Eastern romances. We find, in
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, a cornelian, on which <i>unknown characters</i> were
engraven; and, also, a sabre, like those here described. In the
French king’s library is a curious treatise, entitled <i>Sefat Alaclam</i>;
containing a variety of alphabets, arranged under different heads;
such as the <i>prophetic</i>, the <i>mystical</i>, the <i>philosophic</i>, the <i>magical</i>,
the <i>talismanic</i>, etc., which seems to have escaped the research of
the indefatigable Mr. Astle.&mdash;<i>Arabian Nights</i>, vol. ii, p. 246; vol. i,

<span class="smcap">Page 201.</span></a> <i>... beards burnt off</i></h4>

<p>The loss of the beard, from the earliest ages, was accounted highly
disgraceful. An instance occurs, in the <i>Tales of Inatulla</i>, of one
being <i>singed off</i>, as a mulct on the owner, for having failed to explain
a question propounded; and, in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, a proclamation
may be seen similar to this of Vathek.&mdash;Vol. i, p. 268; vol. ii, p. 228.</p>

<span class="smcap">Page 202.</span></a> <i>The old man put on his green spectacles</i></h4>

<p>This is an apparent anachronism; but such frequently occur in
reading the Arabian writers. It should be remembered, the difficulty
of ascertaining facts and fixing the dates of inventions must
be considerable in a vast extent of country, where books are comparatively
few, and the art of printing unpractised. Though the
origin of <i>spectacles</i> can be traced back, with certainty, no higher
than the thirteenth century, yet the observation of Seneca&mdash;that
letters appeared of an increased magnitude when viewed through
the medium of convex glass&mdash;might have been noted also by others,
and <i>a sort of spectacles</i> contrived, in consequence of it. But, however
this might have been, the art of staining glass is sufficiently
ancient, to have suggested in the days of Vathek the use of <i>green</i>,
as a protection to the eye from a glare of light.</p>

<span class="smcap">Page 214.</span></a> <i>... mutes</i></h4>

<p>It has been usual, in Eastern courts, from time immemorial, to
retain a number of mutes. These are not only employed to amuse
the monarch, but also to instruct his pages in an art to us little
known, of communicating everything by signs, lest the sounds of
their voices should disturb the sovereign.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Habesci’s</span> <i>State of the

These magic rites sufficiently resemble the witch scenes of Middleton,
Shakespeare, etc., to show their Oriental origin. Nor is it to
be wondered if, amongst the many systems adopted from the East,
this should have been in the number. It may be seen, from the
Arabian Tales, that magic was an art publicly taught; and Father
Angelo relates of a rich enchanter, whom he knew at Bassora, that
his pupils were so numerous as to occupy an entire quarter of
the city.</p>

<p>Sir John Chardin speaks of a wine much admired in the East, and
particularly in Persia, called <i>roubnar</i>; which is made from the juice
of the pomegranate, and sent abroad in large quantities. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Oriental sherbets, styled by St. Jerome, <i>sorbitiunculæ delicatæ</i>,
consisted of various syrups (such as lemon, liquorice, capillaire, etc.)
mixed with water. To these, Hasselquist adds several others, and
observes, that the sweet-scented violet is a flower greatly esteemed,
not only for its smell and colour, but, especially, for its use in
<i>sherbet</i>; which, when the Easterns intend to entertain their guests
in an elegant manner, is made of a solution of violet-sugar. Snow,
in the <i>rinfrescos</i> of a hot climate, is almost a constant ingredient.
Thus, in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, Bedreddin Hassan, having filled a
large porcelain bowl with sherbet of roses, put snow into it.</p>

<p>Parchments of the like mysterious import are frequent in the
writings of the Easterns. One in particular, amongst the Arabians,
is held in high veneration. It was written by Ali, and Giafar
Sadek, in mystic characters, and is said to contain the destiny of
the Mahometan religion, and the great events which are to happen
previous to the end of the world. This parchment is of <i>camel’s
skin</i>; but it was usual with Catherine of Medicis to carry about
her person, a legend, in cabalistic characters, inscribed on the skin
of a dead-born infant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>, p. 366. <span class="smcap">Wraxall’s</span> <i>House

<h4><a href="#Note_29" name="Note_219c" id="Note_219c">
<span class="smcap">Page 219.</span></a> <i>Istakar</i></h4>

<p>This city was the ancient Persepolis, and capital of Persia, under
the kings of the three first races. The author of <i>Lebtarikh</i> writes,
that Kischtab there established his abode, erected several temples
to the element of fire, and hewed out for himself and his successors
sepulchres in the rocks of the mountain contiguous to the city.
The ruins of columns and broken figures which still remain, defaced
as they were by Alexander and mutilated by time, plainly evince
that those ancient potentates had chosen it for the place of their
interment. Their monuments, however, must not be confounded
with the superb palace reared by Queen Homai, in the midst of
Istakhar; which the Persians distinguish by the name of <i>Tchilminar</i>,
or the forty watch-towers. The origin of this city is ascribed by
some to Giamschid, and others carry it higher; but the Persian
tradition is, that it was built by the <i>Peris</i>, or Fairies, when the world
was governed by Gian Ben Gian.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>, p. 327.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_30" name="Note_219d" id="Note_219d">
<span class="smcap">Page 219.</span></a> <i>Gian Ben Gian</i></h4>

<p>By this appellation was distinguished the monarch of that species
of beings, whom the Arabians denominate <i>Gian</i> or <i>Ginn</i>; that is,
<i>Genii</i>; and the Tarikh Thabari, <i>Peris</i>, <i>Feez</i>, or <i>Fairies</i>. He was
renowned for his warlike expeditions and stupendous structures.
According to Oriental writers, the pyramids of Egypt were amongst
the monuments of his power. The buckler of this mighty sovereign,
no less famous than that of Achilles, was employed by three successive
Solimans, to achieve their marvellous exploits. From
them, it descended to Tahamurath, surnamed <i>Divbend</i>, or <i>Conqueror
of the</i> <span class="smcap">Giants</span>. This buckler was endowed with most wonderful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
qualities, having been fabricated by talismanic art; and was alone
sufficient to destroy all the charms and enchantments of demons
or giants; which, on the contrary, were wrought by magic. Hence
we are no longer at a loss for the origin of the wonderful shield of
Atlante.</p>

<p>The reign of Gian Ben Gian over the Peris is said to have continued
for two thousand years; after which, <span class="smcap">Eblis</span> was sent by the Deity

the other animals admitted into the paradise of Mahomet</i></h4>

<p>It was a tenet of the Mussulman creed, that all animals would be
raised again, and many of them honoured with admission to paradise.
The story of the seven sleepers, borrowed from Christian legends,
was this: In the days of the Emperor Decius, there were certain
Ephesian youths of a good family, who, to avoid the flames of persecution,
fled to a secret cavern, and there slept for a number of
years. In their flight towards the cave, they were followed by a
dog, which, when they attempted to drive back, said, “<i>I love those
who are dear unto God; go sleep, therefore, and I will guard you.</i>”
For this dog the Mahometans retain so profound a reverence, that
their harshest sarcasm against a covetous person is, “He would not
throw a bone to the dog of the seven sleepers.” It is even said
that their superstition induces them to write his name upon the
letters they send to a distance, as a kind of talisman, to secure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>

internally by three octangular pillars of aloes wood, between which,
on a bar of iron, hangs a row of silver lamps. The outside is covered
with rich black damask, adorned with an embroidered band of

<h4><a href="#Note_51" name="Note_229a" id="Note_229a">
<span class="smcap">Page 229.</span></a> <i>... horrible Kaf</i></h4>

<p>This mountain, which, in reality, is no other than Caucasus, was
supposed to surround the earth, like a ring encompassing a finger.
The sun was believed to rise from one of its eminences (as over
Œta, by the Latin poets), and to set on the opposite; whence,
<i>from Kaf to Kaf</i>, signified, from one extremity of the earth to the
other. The fabulous historians of the East affirm, that this mountain
was founded upon a stone, called <i>sakhrat</i>, one grain of which,
according to Lokman, would enable the possessor to work wonders.
This stone is further described as the pivot of the earth, and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to be one vast emerald, from the refraction of whose beams the
heavens derive their azure. It is added, that whenever God would
excite an earthquake, he commands the stone to move one of its
fibres (which supply in it the office of nerves), and, that being moved,
the part of the earth connected with it quakes, is convulsed, and
sometimes expands. Such is the philosophy of the Koran!</p>

<p>The <i>Tarikh Tabari</i>, written in Persian, analogous to the same
tradition, relates, that, were it not for this emerald, the earth would
be liable to perpetual commotions, and unfit for the abode of
mankind.</p>

<p>To arrive at the Kaf, a vast region,</p>

<p class="center">“Far from the sun and summer gale,”</p>

<p>must be traversed. Over this dark and cheerless desert, the way is
inextricable without the direction of supernatural guidance. Here
the dives or giants were confined, after their defeat by the first
heroes of the human race; and here, also, the peris, or fairies, are
supposed in ordinary to reside. Sukrage, the giant, was king of
Kaf, and had Rucail, one of the children of Adam, for his prime
minister. The giant Argenk, likewise, from the time that Tahamurath
made war upon him, reigned here, and reared a superb
palace in the city of Aherman, with galleries, on whose walls were
painted the creatures that inhabited the world prior to the formation
of Adam.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D’Herbelot</span>, p. 230, etc.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_52" name="Note_229b" id="Note_229b">
<span class="smcap">Page 229.</span></a> <i>... the Simurgh</i></h4>

<p>This is that wonderful bird of the East, concerning which so many
marvels are told: it was not only endowed with reason, but possessed
also the knowledge of every language. Hence it may be concluded
to have been a dive in a borrowed form. This creature relates of
itself that it had seen the great revolution of seven thousand years
twelve times commence and close; and that, in its duration, the
world had been seven times void of inhabitants, and as often
replenished. The Simurgh is represented as a great friend to the
race of Adam, and not less inimical to the dives. Tahamurath and
Aherman were apprised by its predictions of all that was destined
to befall them, and from it they obtained the promise of assistance
in every undertaking. Armed with the buckler of Gian Ben Gian,
Tahamurath was borne by it through the air, over the dark desert,
to Kaf. From its bosom his helmet was crested with plumes, which
the most renowned warriors have ever since worn. In every
conflict the Simurgh was invulnerable, and the heroes it favoured
never failed of success. Though possessed of power sufficient to
exterminate its foes, yet the exertion of that power was supposed to
be forbidden. Sadi, a serious author, gives it as an instance of the
universality of Providence, that the Simurgh, notwithstanding its
immense bulk, is at no loss for sustenance on the mountain of Kaf.
Inatulla hath described Getiafrose, queen of the Genii, as seated
on a golden chariot, drawn by ten simurghs; whose wings extended
wide as the earth-shading bir, and whose talons resembled the
proboscis of mighty elephants: but it does not appear from any
other writer, that there ever was more than <i>one</i>, which is frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>

and we daily repeat prayers, etc.</i></h4>

<p>Amongst the indispensable rules of the Mahometan faith, ablution
is one of the chief. This rite is divided into three kinds. The first,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
performed before prayers, is called <i>Abdest</i>. It begins with washing
both hands, and repeating these words: “Praised be Alla, who
created clean water, and gave it the virtue to purify: he also hath
rendered our faith conspicuous.” This done, water is taken in
the right hand thrice, and the mouth being washed, the worshipper
subjoins: “I pray thee, O Lord, to let me taste of that water which
thou hast given to thy prophet Mahomet in paradise, more fragrant
than musk, whiter than milk, sweeter than honey; and which has
the power to quench for ever the thirst of him that drinks it.”
This petition is accompanied with sniffing a little water into the
nose. The face is then three times washed, and behind the ears;
after which water is taken with both hands, beginning with the
right, and thrown to the elbow. The washing of the crown next
follows, and the apertures of the ear with the thumbs; afterward
the neck with all the fingers, and, finally, the feet. In this last
operation, it is held sufficient to wet the sandal only. At each
ceremonial a suitable petition is offered, and the whole concludes
with this: “Hold me up firmly, O Lord! and suffer not my foot to
slip, that I may not fall from the bridge into hell.” Nothing can
be more exemplary than the attention with which these rites are
performed. If an involuntary cough or sneeze interrupt them, the
whole service is begun anew, and that as often as it happens.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Habesci</span>,

<p>A cafila, or caravan, according to Pitts, is divided into distinct
companies, at the head of which an officer, or person of distinction,
is carried in a kind of horse-litter, and followed by a sumpter camel,
loaded with his treasure. This camel hath a bell fastened to either
side, the sound of which may be heard at a considerable distance.
Others have bells on their necks and their legs, to solace them when
drooping with heat and fatigue. Inatulla also, in his tales, hath
a similar reference: “The bells of the cafila may be rung in the
thirsty desert.” Vol. ii, p. 15. These small bells were known
at Rome from the earliest times, and called from their sounds

Susa and Ecbatana; and Plutarch observes further, that their winters

<p>The laws of Draco are recorded by Plutarch, in his <i>Life of Solon</i>,

than that those laws were of a sanguinary nature, they will
furnish the earliest instance of the use of <i>red characters</i>, which were
afterwards considered as appropriate to supreme authority, and
employed to denounce some requisition or threatening design to

likewise, practised in <i>magic rites</i>. Hence their application to the

Persian, perhaps) <i>Fairies</i>: at least, the peris of the Persian romance
correspond to that imaginary class of beings in our poetical system.
The Italians denominate them <i>Fata</i>, in allusion to their power of
charming and enchanting; thus the <i>Manto fatidica</i> of Virgil is
rendered in <i>Orlando</i>, <i>La Fata Manto</i>. The term ginn being common
to both peris and dives, some have erroneously fancied that the
peris were female dives. This appellation, however, served only
to discriminate their common nature from the angelic and human,
without respect to their qualities, moral or personal. Thus, the
dives are hideous and wicked, whilst the peris are beautiful and
good. Amongst the Persian poets, the beauty of the peris is
proverbial: insomuch that a woman superlatively handsome, is
styled by them, <i>the offspring of a Peri</i>.</p>

Greeks by the name of Persepolis; and there is still extant in the
East a tradition, that, when Alexander burnt the edifices of the
Persian kings, seven stupendous structures of Giamschid were
consumed with his palace. This prince, after having subjected to
his empire seven vast provinces of Upper Asia, and enjoyed in peace
a long reign (which some authors have protracted to 700 years),
became intoxicated with his greatness; and, foolishly fancying it
would have no end, arrogated to himself divine honours. But the
Almighty raised up, even in his own house, a terrible instrument
to abase his pride, by whom he was easily overcome, and driven
into exile.</p>

<p>The author of <i>Giame al tavatikh</i> mentions the cup, or concave
mirror of Giamschid, formed of a gem, and called the cup of the
sun. To this vessel the Persian poets often refer, and allegorize
it in different ways. They attribute to it the property of exhibiting
everything in the compass of nature, and even some things that are
preternatural. The gem it consisted of appears to be the carbuncle
or oriental ruby; which, from its resemblance to a burning coal,
and the splendour it was supposed to emit in the dark, was called
Schebgerag, or, the torch of the night. According to Strabo, it
obtained its high estimation amongst the Persians, who were
worshippers of fire, from its igneous qualities; and perhaps those
virtues for which it hath been styled “the first of stones.”</p>

the Old Serpent:</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_139" name="Note_273a" id="Note_273a">
<span class="smcap">Page 273.</span></a> <i>In my lifetime I filled, etc.</i></h4>

<p>This recital agrees perfectly with those in the Koran, and other
Arabian legends.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_140" name="Note_274a" id="Note_274a">
<span class="smcap">Page 274.</span></a> <i>... an unrelenting fire preys on my heart</i></h4>

<p>Hariri, to convey the most forcible idea of extreme anxiety,
represents the heart as tormented by fierce burning coals. This
form of speech, it is observed, is <i>proverbial</i>; but do we not see
whence the proverb arose?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chappelow’s</span> <i>Six Assemblies</i>, p. 106.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_141" name="Note_275a" id="Note_275a">
<span class="smcap">Page 275.</span></a> <i>Carathis on the back of an afrit</i></h4>

<p>The expedition of the afrit in fetching Carathis is characteristic
of this order of dives. We read in the Koran that another of the
fraternity offered to bring the Queen of Sheba’s throne to Solomon
before he could rise from his place.&mdash;Ch. xxvii.</p>

<h4><a href="#Note_142" name="Note_277a" id="Note_277a">
<span class="smcap">Page 277.</span></a> <i>... glanced off in a rapid whirl that rendered her
invisible</i></h4>

<p>It was not ill conceived to punish Carathis by a rite, and one
of the principal characteristics of that science in which she so much
delighted, and which was the primary cause of Vathek’s perdition
and of her own. The circle, the emblem of eternity, and the symbol
of the sun, was held sacred in the most ancient ceremonies of incantations;
and the whirling round deemed as a necessary operation
in magical mysteries. Was not the name of the greatest enchantress
in fabulous antiquity, Circe, derived from <ins class="grk" title="kirkos">κιρκος</ins>, a circle, on
account of her magical revolutions, and of the circular appearance
and motion of the sun, her father? The fairies and elves used to
arrange themselves in a ring on the grass; and even the augur, in
the liturgy of the Romans, whirled round to encompass the four
cardinal points of the world. It is remarkable, that a derivative
of the verb, rendered, <i>to whirl in a magical manner</i> (<a href="#Page_257">see page 257</a>),
which corresponds to the Hebrew <ins class="hbw" title="SHR">סחר</ins>, and is interpreted <i>scindere,
secare se in orbem, inde notio circinandi, mox gyrandi, et hinc à
motu versatili, fascinavit, incantavit</i>, signifies in the Koran
<i>the glimmering of twilight</i>: a sense deducible from the shapeless
glimpses of objects when hurried round with the velocity here
described, and very applicable to the sudden disappearance of
Carathis, who, like the stone in a sling, by the progressive and rapid
increase of the circular motion, soon ceased to be perceptible.
Nothing can impress a greater awe upon the mind than does this
passage in the original.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
